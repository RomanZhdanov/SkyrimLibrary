The Mad Prince will ply profitless bargains and promote senseless bloodshed for nothing more than the joy of another\u0027s confusion, tragedy, or rage. So it was that Sheogorath had set a stage on which to play himself as rival to Hircine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWithout haste, the coy Prince proffered his contest; each Prince was to groom a beast to meet at this place again, three years to the hour, and do fatal battle. Expressionless behind his fearsome countenance, Hircine agreed, and with naught but a dusting of snow in the drift, the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Daedric_Princes\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Daedric Princes\u0022\u003EPrinces\u003C/a\u003E were gone to their realms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EConfident, but knowing Sheogorath for a trickster, Hircine secretly bred an abomination in his hidden realm.

The Prince of the Hunt struck his spear to the ground, bringing forth his unnatural, snarling behemoth. Doffing his cap, sly as ever, Sheogorath stood and stepped aside to reveal a tiny, colorful bird perched atop the stone. Demurely it chirped in the bristling gusts, scarcely audible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a twisted, springing heap, the Daedroth was upon the stone, leaving only rubble where the boulder had been. Thinking itself victorious, the monster\u0027s bloodied maw curled into a mock grin, when a subdued song drifted in the crisp air. The tiny bird lightly hopped along the snout of the furious Daedroth. Sheogorath looked on, quietly mirthful, as the diminutive creature picked at a bit of detritus caught in scales betwixt the fiery eyes of the larger beast. With howling fury, the were-thing blinded itself trying to pluck away the nuisance. And so it continued for hours, Hircine looking on in shame while his finest beast gradually destroyed itself in pursuit of the seemingly oblivious bird, all the while chirping a mournful tune to the lonesome range.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELivid, but beaten, Hircine burned the ragged corpse and withdrew to his realm, swearing in forgotten tongues.

The desire saturated his mind -- there was nothing in the world except flight. He looked around for landmarks, anything to place himself or to use as a target, but to no avail -- the featureless grasslands through which he was sprinting extended as far as the eye could see. \u0022Just have to keep running\u0022, he thought to himself. \u0022I have to run as fast as I can\u0022.

Through dreams of inspiration, I have nurtured literary talent into fruition, and now he stands in acclaim as an emerging bard and poet! He will gain much favor before I tire of him.\u0022 Sheogorath, too, gazed at the young Breton artist and saw that he was indeed famous among the other mortals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hmmm,\u0022 mused Sheogorath, \u0022but how many are there who hate this mortal whom you have built? It is the hatred of the mortals which confirms greatness, and not their love. Surely you can accomplish this as well?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EVaernima\u0027s eyes narrowed. \u0022Yes, the mortals are indeed often foolish and petty, and it is true that many of their most bold have been despised. Do not worry, mad one, for I have the power to achieve many forms of greatness with this one, hatred among them.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Perhaps, Dreamweaver, it would be amusing to show who has this power?

I shall take pleasure in revealing this to you, as I bring the more subtle horrors out of this mortal\u0027s subconscious.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so, in the 19th year of his life, the dreams Darius Shano had been experiencing began to change. Fear had always been part of the night for him, but now there was something else. A darkness began to creep into his slumber, a darkness that sucked away all feeling and color, leaving only emptiness behind. When this happened, he opened his mouth to scream, but found that the darkness had taken his voice as well. All he had was the terror and the void, and each night they filled him with a new understanding of death. Yet, when he woke, there was no fear, for he had faith that his Lady had a purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed, one night Vaernima herself emerged from the void. She leaned in close to whisper into his ear.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Watch carefully, my beloved!\u0022 With that, she pulled the void away, and for hours each night she would reveal to Darius the most horrible perversions of nature. Men being skinned and eaten alive by other men, unimaginable beasts of many limbs and mouths, entire populations being burned -- their screams filled his every evening. In time, these visions gnawed at his soul, and his work began to take on the character of his nightmares. The images revealed to him at night were reproduced on the page, and the terrible cruelty and hollow vice that his work contained both revolted and fascinated the public. They reveled in their disgust over every detail. There were those who openly enjoyed his shocking material, and his popularity among some only fed the hatred of those who found him abhorrent. This continued for several years, while the infamy of Darius grew steadily. Then, in his 29th year, without warning, the dreams and nightmares ceased.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDarius felt a weight lifted, as he no longer endured the nightly tortures, but was confused. \u0022What have I done to displease my Mistress?\u0022, he wondered aloud. \u0022Why has she abandoned me?\u0022 Vaernima never answered his prayers. No one ever answered, and the restless dreams faded away to leave Darius in long, deep sleeps.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EInterest in the works of Darius Shano waned. His prose became stale and his ideas failed to provoke the shock and outrage they once had. As the memory of his notoriety and of his terrible dreams faded, the questions that raced in his mind eventually produced resentment against Vaernima, his former mistress. Resentment grew into hatred, from hatred came ridicule, and over time ridicule became disbelief. Slowly it became obvious -- Vaernima had never spoken to him at all; his dreams were simply the product of a sick mind that had righted itself. He had been deceived by his own subconscious, and the anger and shame overwhelmed him. The man who once conversed with a deity drifted steadily into heresy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn time, all of the bitterness, doubt, and sacrilege focused in Darius a creative philosophy that was threaded throughout all of his subsequent work. He challenged the Gods themselves, as well as the infantile public and corrupt state for worshiping them. He mocked them all with perverse caricatures, sparing no one and giving no quarter. He challenged the Gods in public to strike him down if they existed, and ridiculed them when no such comeuppance was delivered. To all of this, the people reacted with outrage far greater than they had shown his previous work. His early career had offended only sensibilities, but now he was striking directly at the heart of the people.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHis body of work grew in size and intensity. Temples, nobles, and commoners were all targets of his scorn. Finally, at age 39, Darius wrote a piece entitled \u0022The Noblest Fool,\u0022 ridiculing The Emperor God \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Tiber_Septim\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Tiber Septim\u0022\u003ETiber Septim\u003C/a\u003E for integrating into the pathetic \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Nine_Divines\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Nine Divines\u0022\u003ENine Divines\u003C/a\u003E cult.

His last, bitter words were gurgled through a mouthful of his own blood.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E20 years after their wager was first placed, Vaernima and Sheogorath met over Darius Shano\u0027s headless corpse. The Dreamweaver had been eager for this meeting; she had been waiting for years to confront the Daedric Prince over his lack of action.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I have been deceived by you, Sheogorath! I performed my half of the bargain, but during your ten years you never contacted the mortal once. He owes none of his greatness to you or your talents or your influence!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Nonsense,\u0022 croaked the Madgod. \u0022I was with him all along! When your time ended and mine began, your whispers in his ear were replaced with silence. I severed his link to that from which he found the most comfort and meaning, and withheld the very attention the creature so desperately craved. Without his mistress, this man\u0027s character could ripen under resentment and hatred. Now his bitterness is total and, overcome by a madness fueled by his rage, he feeds me in my realm as an eternal servant.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESheogorath turned and spoke to the empty space by his side.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Indeed; Darius Shano was a glorious mortal. Despised by his own people, his kings, and even by the Gods he mocked. For my success, I shall accept three-score followers of Vaernima into my service. And the dreamers will awaken as madmen.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd thus did Sheogorath teach Vaernima that without madness, there are no dreams, and no creation.

Late in his fifteenth year, Emmeg forged by hand an ornate suit of scaled armor, a rite of ascension among his tribe. On a blustery day, he pounded the final rivet, and draping a heavy cloak over the bulky mantle, Emmeg set out from his village for the last time. Word of his exploits always returned home, whether defending merchant caravans from brigands or liberating enslaved beast folk. News of the noble Orc crusader began to grace even the lips of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Breton\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Breton\u0022\u003EBreton\u003C/a\u003Es, often with a tinge of fear.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELess than two years after ascending to maturity, Gro-Kayra was making camp when a thin voice called out from the thickening night.

From the voice alone he had thought the interloper an old hag, but he now decided that he was in the presence of a man of slight and lanky build, though he could discern no further detail.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Perhaps,\u0027 the wary Orc began, \u0027but I seek no glory.

Emmeg cautiously removed the rags in which the object was swathed, and was dazzled to discover the item to be a wide, curved blade with ornately decorated handle. The weapon had heft, and Emmeg realized on brandishing it that the elaborate pommel disguised the more practical purpose of balancing the considerable weight of the blade itself. It was nothing much to look at in its present condition, thought the Orc, but once the tarnish was cleaned away and a few missing jewels restored, it would indeed be a blade worthy of a champion ten times his own worth.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Her name is \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Neb-Crescen\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Neb-Crescen\u0022\u003ENeb-Crescen\u003C/a\u003E\u0027 spoke the thin stranger, seeing the appreciation lighting Gro-Kayra\u0027s face. \u0027I got her for a \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Horse\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Horse\u0022\u003Ehorse\u003C/a\u003E and a secret in warmer climes, but in my old age I\u0027d be lucky to even lift such a weapon. It\u0027s only proper that I pass her on to one such as yourself. To possess her is to change your life, forever.\u0027 Overcoming his initial infatuation with the arc of honed steel, Emmeg turned his attention back to the visitor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Your words are fine, old man,\u0027 Emmeg said, not masking his suspicion, \u0027but I\u0027m no fool. You traded for this blade once, and you\u0027ll trade for it again tonight. What is it that you want?\u0027 The stranger\u0027s shoulders slumped, and Emmeg was glad to have unveiled the true purpose of this twilight visit. He sat with him a while, eventually offering a stack of furs, warm food, and a handful of coins in exchange for the exotic weapon. By morning, the stranger was gone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the week following Emmeg\u0027s encounter with the stranger, Neb-Crescen had not left its scabbard. He had encountered no enemy in the woods, and his meals consisted of fowl and small game caught with bow and arrow. The peace suited him fine, but on the seventh morning, while fog still crept between the low-hanging boughs, Emmeg\u0027s ears pricked up at the telltale crunch of a nearby footfall in the dense snow and forest debris.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEmmeg\u0027s nostrils flared, but he was upwind. Being unable to see or smell his guest, and knowing that the breeze carried his scent in that direction, Emmeg\u0027s guard was up, and he cautiously drew Neb-Crescen from its sheath. Emmeg himself was not entirely sure of all that happened next.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first moment of conscious memory in Emmeg Gro-Kayra\u0027s mind after drawing Neb-Crescen was the image of the curved blade sweeping through the air in front of him, spattering blood over the virginal powder coating the forest floor. The second memory was a feeling of frenzied bloodlust creeping over him, but it was then that he saw for the first time his victim, an Orc woman perhaps a few years younger than himself, her body a canvas of grisly wounds, enough to kill a strong man ten times over.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEmmeg\u0027s disgust overwhelmed the madness that had overtaken him, and with all his will enlisted, he released Neb-Crescen from his grip and let the blade sail.

Turala had seen orcs before, but never in such abundance, never with such bestial confidence. Roaring with delight at the horse and its confused state, they hastened past the timber where Cassyr, Turala, and Bosriel hid. The wildflowers flew into the air at their stampede, powdering the air with seeds. Turala tried to hold back a sneeze, and thought she succeeded.

He followed the Swimmer to a cave, swimming deeper and deeper, his lungs burning and his limbs exhausted. At last, he found a pocket of air, and there, in the dark, he found the Waters of Life.

Aevar knew he could not stand against such a force, and that he must retrieve the seeds in secret.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAevar reached into his pouch and drew out his \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Flint\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Flint\u0022\u003Eflint\u003C/a\u003E. Gathering leaves, he started a small fire outside the clearing where the Falmer and the ensorcelled Spirits milled. All the Skaal know the Spirits\u0027 hatred of fires, for the fires ravage the trees they serve. At once, the Nature of the Spirits took hold, and they rushed to quell the flames. During the commotion, Aevar snuck behind the Falmer and snatched the pouch of Seeds, stealing away before the evil being knew they were gone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen Aevar returned to the Tree Stone, he planted the tree in the ground, and the All-Maker spoke to him.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The Gift of Trees is restored.

The air inside was thick and heavy, and he could see no farther than the end of his arm. Still, he felt his way along the walls, though he heard the shuffling of feet and knew that this place held the Unholy Beasts who would tear his flesh and eat his bones. For hours he crept along, until he saw a faint glow far at the end of the hall.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere, from behind a sheet of perfect ice, came a glow so bright he had to shut his eyes, lest they be forever blinded.

Slowly, the light crept out between the cracks, widening them, splitting the ice wall into pieces. With a deafening crack, the wall crumbled, and the light rushed over Aevar and through the Halls. He heard the shrieks of the Unholy Beasts as they were blinded and burned. He ran out of the Halls, following the light, and collapsed on the ground outside.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen he was able to rise again, the Sun again warmed him, and he was glad for that.

He looked in the trees, but the Greedy Man did not hide there. Nor did he hide near the oceans, or the deep caves, and the beasts had not seen him in the dark forests. Finally, Aevar came to a crooked house, and he knew that here he would find the Greedy Man.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Who are you,\u0022 shouted the Greedy Man, \u0022that you would come to my house?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I am Aevar of the Skaal,\u0022 said Aevar. \u0022I am not warrior, shaman, or elder.

He walked back to the Wind Stone, where the All-Maker spoke to him a final time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You have done well, Aevar.

When I journeyed to the stark white province, I was surprised to find a people whose views on Akatosh are almost diametrically opposed to those of the Altmer. The majority of Nord people seem to believe that their Alduin of legend is not Akatosh, but another deity entirely. A great \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Dragon\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Dragon\u0022\u003Edragon\u003C/a\u003E, yes, but not the Great Dragon.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDetermined to get to the heart of this matter, I consulted with several Nords, chief among them an old and respected clan chief by the name of Bjorn Much-Bloodied. And what surprised me most about those I talked to was not that they believed in Alduin instead of Akatosh, but that they recognized Alduin in addition to Akatosh. In fact, most children of Skyrim seem to view Akatosh in much the same way I do - he is, in fact, the Great Dragon. First among the Divines, perseverance personified and, more than anything, a force of supreme good in the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlduin, they claim, is something altogether different.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether or not he is actually a deity remains in question, but the Alduin of Nord folklore is in fact a dragon, but one so ancient, and so powerful, he was dubbed the \u0022World Eater,\u0022 and some accounts even have him devouring the souls of the dead to maintain his own power. Other stories revolve around Alduin acting as some sort of dragon king, uniting the other dragons in a war against mankind, until he was eventually defeated at the hands of one or more brave heroes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is hard to deny that such legends are compelling. But as both High Priest and scholar, I am forced to ask that most important of questions - where is the evidence?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Nords of Skyrim place a high value on their oral traditions, but such is the core of their unreliability. A rumor passed around the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Wayrest\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Wayrest\u0022\u003EWayrest\u003C/a\u003E market square can change so dramatically in the course of a few simple hours, that by the end of the day, one might believe half the city\u0027s residents were involved in any number of scandalous activities.

They can block incoming spells, negating your opponent\u0027s attack and wasting his magicka. A good mage knows, however, to not rely too heavily on her ward. Keeping a ward readied for too long will leave a caster drained of magicka, unable to retaliate, and at worst unable to maintain the ward and therefore completely defenseless.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E4. Two hands are not always better than one\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAny advanced spellcaster has learned to cast spells with both hands, dealing more damage. There are certainly times when this is to your advantage, such as when an opponent is already weakened, or when it is likely to draw a bigger reaction from the crowd that has no doubt gathered to watch you. It is not always the best strategy, however. Concentration spells, for example, can often be used on the ground when an opponent is especially nimble. In that instance, using both hands independently can cover more ground at the same time. A mage throwing fireballs with both hands cannot immediately raise a ward to defend herself, or heal while she continues to attack.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E5.

Following closely behind, though, is your need to please the crowd. You are, after all, depending on their generosity to fund your adventures. Here, then, more than magic comes into play. If you can gain a sense of your opponent\u0027s ability before the duel begins, you can enter into the event with confidence. Knowing that you outclass your opponent is of great importance, as it means you can confidently give the crowd a better show. Likewise, knowing ahead of time that you could very well lose a duel, you are afforded an opportunity to suddenly find yourself engaged elsewhere, and be unable to attend the event. (By no means do I suggest that I have ever done such a thing; I simply find that my great fame occasionally means I am unable to respond to every single request for a duel)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKeep these few things in mind, keep your wits about you, and you too can make a name for yourself by putting on great displays of magical prowess.

They march on the East, the battlemages surrender before their armies, and they take the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:White-Gold_Tower\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:White-Gold Tower\u0022\u003ECitadel\u003C/a\u003E.

These assassinations are blamed on the enemies of Cuhlecain, which, for political reasons, are still the Western Reach. \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Zurin_Arctus\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Zurin Arctus\u0022\u003EZurin Arctus\u003C/a\u003E, the Grand Battlemage (not the Underking), then crowns Hjalti as Tiber Septim, new Emperor of All Cyrodiil. After he captures the Imperial Throne, Septim finds the initial administration of a fully united Cyrodiil a time-consuming task. He sends the Underking to deal with Imperial expansion into Skyrim and High Rock. Ysmir, mindful that it might seem as if Tiber Septim is in two places at once, works behind the scenes. This period of levelheaded statesmanship and diplomacy, this sudden silence, heretofore unknown in the roaring tales of Talosian conquest, are explained away later. (The assassination story is embroidered -- now it is popularly Talos\u0027 own throat that was cut.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe human kingdoms are conquered, even \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Hammerfell\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Hammerfell\u0022\u003EHammerfell\u003C/a\u003E, whose capture was figured to be an arduous task. The Underking wants a complete invasion, a chance to battle their foreign wind spirits himself, but Tiber Septim refutes him. He has already made a better plan, one that will seem to legitimize his rule. Cyrodiil supports the losing side of a civil war and are invited in. Finally, the Empire can turn its eyes onto the Elves.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Underking continues to press on Tiber Septim the need to conquer Morrowind. The Emperor is not sure that it is a wise idea. He has heard of the Tribunal\u0027s power. The Underking wants his vengeance, and reminds Tiber Septim that he is fated to conquer the Elves, even the Tribunal. Arctus advises against the move but Septim covets the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Ebony\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Ebony\u0022\u003EEbony\u003C/a\u003E in Morrowind, as he sorely needs a source of capital to rebuild Cyrodiil after 400 years of war.

The Ebony need wins out in the end. The Empire invades Morrowind, and the Tribunal give up. When certain conditions of the Armistice include not only a policy of noninterference with the Tribunal, but also, in the Underking\u0027s eyes, a validation of their religious beliefs, Ysmir is furious. He abandons the Empire completely. This was the betrayal the Greybeards spoke of. Or so he thinks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWithout the Underking\u0027s power, all ideas of conquering Tamriel vanish.

This Numidium is what he needs to conquer the world. It is his destiny to have it. He contacts the Underking and says he was right all along. They should kill the Tribunal, and they need to get together and make a plan. While the Underking was away he realized the true danger of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Dagoth_Ur_(god)\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Dagoth Ur (god)\u0022\u003EDagoth-Ur\u003C/a\u003E.

With his last breath, the Underking\u0027s Heart roars a hole through the Battlemage\u0027s chest. In the end, everyone is dead, the Underking has reverted back to ash, and Tiber Septim strolls in to take the soulgem. When the Elder Council arrives, he tells them about the second attempt on his life, this time by his trusted battle mage, Zurin Arctus, who was attempting a coup. He has the dead guards celebrated as heroes, even the one who was blasted to ash... He warns Cyrodiil about the dangers within, but says he has a solution to the dangers without.

In the distance, there seemed to be mountains, but they constantly shifted, and Scotti realized they were banks of mist and fog.

The seats were hard on his middle-aged back and buttocks, but the bumping rhythm of the caravan, and the hypnotic waving reeds gradually had an effect on him, and Scotti drifted off to sleep.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe awoke in the dark some hours later, not sure where he was. The caravan was no longer moving, and he was on the floor, under the bench, next to some small boxes. There were voices, speaking a hissing, clicking language Scotti didn\u0027t understand, and he peeked out between someone\u0027s legs to see what was happening.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe moons barely pierced the thick mist surrounding the caravan, and Scotti did not have the best angle to see who was talking. For a moment, it looked like the gray wagonmaster was talking to himself, but the darkness had movement and moisture, in fact, glistening scales. It was hard to tell how many of these things there were, but they were big, black, and the more Scotti looked at them, the more details he could see\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen one particular detail emerged, huge mouths filled with dripping needle-like fangs, Scotti slipped back under the bench. Their black little eyes had not fallen on him yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe legs in front of Scotti moved and then began to thrash, as their owner was grabbed and pulled out of the wagon. Scotti crouched further back, getting behind the little boxes. He didn\u0027t know much about concealment, but had some experience with shields. He knew that having something, anything, in between you and bad things was always good.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA few seconds after the legs had disappeared from sight, there was a horrible scream. And then a second and a third. Different timbres, different accents, but the same inarticulate message... terror, and pain, horrible pain. Scotti remembered a long forgotten prayer to the god \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Stendarr\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Stendarr\u0022\u003EStendarr\u003C/a\u003E and whispered it to himself.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThen there was silence... ghastly silence that lasted only a few minutes, but which seemed like hours... years.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then the carriage started rolling forward again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EScotti cautiously crawled out from under the carriage. Chaero Gemullus gave him a bemused grin.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022There you are,\u0022 he said. \u0022I thought the Nagas took you.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Nagas?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Nasty characters,\u0022 Gemullus said, frowning. \u0022Puff adders with legs and arms, seven feet tall, eight when they\u0027re mad.

His mud and fleshfly-bespeckled clothing seemed eminently middle-class, at best, to him. \u0022What would they want me for?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022To rob, of course,\u0022 the Imperial smiled. \u0022And to kill. You didn\u0027t notice what happened to the others?\u0022 The Imperial frowned, as if struck by a thought. \u0022You didn\u0027t sample from those boxes down below, did you? Like the sugar, do you?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Gods, no,\u0022 Scotti grimaced.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Imperial nodded, relieved. \u0022You just seem a little slow. First time to Black Marsh, I gather? Oh! Heigh ho, Hist piss!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EScotti was just about to ask Gemullus what that vulgar term meant when the rain began. It was an inferno of foul-smelling, yellow-brown rain that washed over the caravan, accompanied by the growl of thunder in the distance. Gemullus worked to pull the roof up over the wagon, glaring at Scotti until he helped with the laborious process.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe shuddered, not only from the cold damp, but from contemplation of the disgusting precipitation pouring down on the already nasty produce in the uncovered wagon.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We\u0027ll be dry soon enough,\u0022 Gemullus smiled, pointing out into the fog.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EScotti had never been to Gideon, but he knew what to expect.

When he opened his eyes, he found that he was entirely surrounded by a translucent goo, and was traveling rapidly forward, southward, gliding through the mud as if it were air, skipping along an intricate network of roots. Scotti felt confusion and euphoria in equal measures, madly rushing forward through an alien environment of darkness, spinning around and over the thick fibrous tentacles of the trees. It was if he were high in the sky at midnight, not deep beneath the swamp in the \u003Ca href=\u0022/w/index.php?title=Skyrim:Underground_Express\u0026amp;action=edit\u0026amp;redlink=1\u0022 class=\u0022new\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Underground Express (page does not exist)\u0022\u003EUnderground Express\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELooking up slightly at the massive root structure above, Scotti saw something wriggle past.

But there was no other way to look at the situation. Scotti had gone from eating living fish to being eaten alive as a way of transport. He was in one of those worms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EScotti made an executive decision to faint.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe awoke in stages, having a beautiful dream of being held in a woman\u0027s warm embrace.

Now it was like the sky at sunrise, in pinks and reds. Scotti remembered Gemullus telling him to look for the red clay, and he would be near Gideon. The next thing he had to find was the bubbles.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere were no bubbles anywhere.

He began to squirm, and the creature began to move faster at the increased pressure from within.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly, Scotti saw it ahead of him, a slim spire of bubbles rising up through the mud from some underground stream, straight up, through the roots to the surface above him. The moment the rootworm went through it, Scotti pushed with all of his might upward, bursting through the creature\u0027s thin skin. The bubbles pushed Scotti up quickly, and before he could blink, he was popping out of the red slushy mud.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo gray Argonians were standing under a tree nearby, holding a net.

Most had rotten crops from harvests past still clinging to wilted vines, orchards of desolate, leafless trees.

Scotti was given an office even larger than Lord Vanech\u0027s, and he met with each.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst among the Commission\u0027s clients were five independent traders, blustering and loaded with gold, demanding to know what Scotti intended to do about improving the trade routes. Scotti summarized for them the conditions of the main roads, the state of the merchants\u0027 caravans, the sunken bridges, and all the other impediments between the frontier and the marketplace. They told him to have everything replaced and repaired, and gave him the gold necessary to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWithin three months, the bridge at Slough Point had disappeared into the muck; the great caravan had collapsed into decrepitude; and the main road from Gideon had been utterly swallowed up by swamp water. The Argonians began once again to use the old ways, their personal rafts and sometimes the Underground Express to transport the grain in small quantities. It took a third of the time, two weeks, to arrive in Cyrodiil, none of it rotten.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Archbishop of Mara was the next client Scotti met with.

As the Archeins went bankrupt, their slaves returned to his parents\u0027 tiny farms.

They wanted more Imperial guards on the border at Slough Point, more magically lit lanterns posted along the main roads at regular intervals, more patrol stations, and more schools built to allow young Argonians to better themselves and not turn to crime.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWithin six months, there were no more Nagas roaming the roads, as there were no merchants traveling them to rob. The thugs returned to the fetid inner swamp, where they felt much happier, their constitutions enriched by the rot and pestilence that they loved. Tsleeixth and his constituency were so pleased by the crime rate dropping, they brought even more gold to Decumus Scotti, telling him to keep up the good work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBlack Marsh simply was, is, and always shall be unable to sustain a large-scale, cash-crop plantation economy. The Argonians, and anyone else, the whole of Tamriel, could live in Black Marsh on subsistence farming, just raising what they needed. That was not sad, Scotti thought; that was hopeful.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EScotti\u0027s solution to each of their dilemmas had been the same. Ten percent of the gold they gave him went to Lord Vanech\u0027s Building Commission.

He would have preferred more time, but he recognized the nature of the test. The situation in Armanias was urgent. The Empire had to select their armorer quickly, and once selected, the preferred armorer had to act swiftly and produce the finest armor and weaponry for the Imperial army in Black Marsh. It wasn\u0027t just the best armorer they were looking for. It was the most efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESaccus had only begun steaming the half-inch strips of black virgin oak to bend into bands for the flanges of the armor joints when there was a knock at his door. His assistant Phandius ushered in the visitor. It was a tall reptilian of common markings, a dull, green-fringed hood, bright black eyes, and a dull brown cloak. It was Hazadir, Katariah\u0027s preferred armorer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I wanted to wish you the best of luck on the \u2014 is that \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Ebony\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Ebony\u0022\u003Eebony\u003C/a\u003E?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was indeed. Saccus had bought the finest quality ebony weave available in the Imperial City as soon as he heard of the competition and had begun the process of smelting it. Normally it was a six-month procedure refining the ore, but he hoped that a massive convection oven stoked by white flames born of magicka would shorten the operation to three days. Saccus proudly pointed out the other advancements in his armory. The acidic lime pools to sharpen the blade of the dai-katana to an unimaginable degree of sharpness. The \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Akavir\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Akavir\u0022\u003EAkavir\u003C/a\u003Ei forge and tongs he would use to fold the ebony back and forth upon itself.

He had, after all, seen the shop and knew that what Hazadir said was true. It was a pathetic workshop in the slums, fit only for the lowliest of adventurers to get their iron daggers and cuirasses repaired. Saccus had decided to make the best quality regardless of the inferiority of his rival. It was his way and how he became the best armorer in the Imperial City.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOut of kindness, and more than a bit of pride, Saccus showed Hazadir how, by contrast, things should be done in a real professional armory. The Argonian acted as an apprentice to Saccus, helping him refine the ebony ore, and to pound it and fold it when it cooled. Over the next several days, they worked together to create a beautiful dai-katana with an edge honed sharp enough to trim a mosquito\u0027s eyebrows, enchanted with flames along its length by one of the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Imperial_Battlemages\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Imperial Battlemages\u0022\u003EImperial Battlemages\u003C/a\u003E, as well as a suit of armor of bound wood, leather, silver, and ebony to resist the winds of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Oblivion\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Oblivion\u0022\u003EOblivion\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the day of the battle, Saccus, Hazadir, and Phandius finished polishing the armor and brought in Raphalas Eul for the fitting. Hazadir left only then, realizing that Nandor Beraid would be at his shop shortly to be outfitted.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe two warriors met before the Empress and Imperial Council in the arena, which had been flooded slightly to simulate the swampy conditions of Black Marsh. From the moment Saccus saw Eul in his suit of heavy ebony and blazing dai-katana and Beraid in his collection of dusty, rusted lizard-scales and spear from Hazadir\u0027s shop, he knew who would win. And he was right.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first blow from the dai-katana lodged in Beraid\u0027s soft shield, as there was no metal trim to deflect it. Before Eul could pull his sword back, Beraid let go of the now-flaming shield, still stuck on the sword, and poked at the joints of Eul\u0027s ebony armor with his spear. Eul finally retrieved his sword from the ruined shield and slashed at Beraid, but his light armor was scaled and angled, and the attacks rolled off into the water, extinguishing the dai-katana\u0027s flames. When Beraid struck at Eul\u0027s feet, he fell into the churned mud and was unable to move. The Empress, out of mercy, called a victor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHazadir received the commission and thanks to his knowledge of Argonian battle tactics and weaponry and how best to combat them, he designed implements of war that brought down the insurrection in Armanias.

The man promised to show his nephew the business and eventually make him a partner when he was old enough. In the meantime, the boy was put to work as his uncle\u0027s house servant.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was a grueling life as the old man was very particular about how things should be done. The boy was first required to give all the floors in the house a thorough scouring, from the attic to the cellar. Whenever the floor was not cleaned to the uncle\u0027s satisfaction, which was frequent, Torik was thrashed and forced to begin again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe boy\u0027s second duty was to ring the bell that would bring the laborers into the house. This was done at least four times a day, once for each meal, but if his uncle had any news or additional instructions for the laborers - which he frequently did - the bell might need to be sounded a dozen times or more. It was a huge iron bell in the tower and the boy quickly discovered that he had to throw his entire body into the motion of pulling the chain in order to have it sound loud enough to bring everyone in from the field. If he was tired and did not pull the backbreaking chain hard enough, his uncle was soon at his side to beat him until he rang the bell loud and clear.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETorik\u0027s third task was dusting all the shelves in his uncle\u0027s vast library. As deep and old as the shelves were, he was required to work with a long, heavy duster on a rod. The only way that he could reach to the back of the shelves was to hold the duster at his shoulder and then swing it out in a sweeping motion. Again, if the uncle saw any dust left over or felt that the boy was not working as hard as he ought to, the punishment was swift and severe.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter several years, Minas Torik grew into a young man, but his job responsibilities were not increased. His uncle promised to teach him the business, once Torik had demonstrated his mastery of his servile assignments. Divorced from any knowledge of any work other than his own, Torik never knew how badly in debt his uncle was and how poorly the farm\u0027s yield was.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn his eighteenth year, Torik was called into the cellar by his uncle.

Among his uncle\u0027s possessions being packed away was an old heavy iron axe, allegedly of Dwemer manufacture. He picked it up in his hands and was surprised to find that it was not much heavier than his dusting rod. In fact, it felt very comfortable as he pulled it over his shoulder and swung it out as he had done so many times before. In this instance, however, he swung it into his uncle\u0027s right arm.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe old man screamed with pain and rage, but for some reason, Torik didn\u0027t feel frightened anymore. He propped the axe against his other shoulder, and swung it out again. It cut a swath across the old man\u0027s chest and he fell to the floor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETorik hesitated before lifting the axe above his head. It was another natural position for him, like he was ringing a bell. Over and over again, he swung down as if he was calling the laborers in from the field. Except that this time, there was no sound except for a wet thump, and no laborers came in from the field. Of course, his uncle had sent them away hours before.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter a time, there was nothing left of his uncle that couldn\u0027t be washed down the cellar drain.

Somehow Dagoth Ur and his retainers escaped, but we gained the tools, and delivered them to Sotha Sil for study and safe-keeping.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor some years we kept the oaths we swore to Azura with Nerevar, but during that time, in secret, Sotha Sil must have studied the tools and divined their mysteries. And at last he came to us with a vision of a new world of peace, with justice and honor for nobles, and health and prosperity for the commoners, with the Tribunal as immortal patrons and guides. And dedicating ourselves to this vision of a better world, we made a pilgrimage to Red Mountain and transformed ourselves with the power of Kagrenac\u0027s tools.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd no sooner than we had completed our rituals and begun to discover our new-found powers, the Daedra Lord Azura appeared and cursed us for our foresworn oaths. By her powers of prophecy, she assured us that her champion, Nerevar, true to his oath, would return to punish us for our perfidy, and to make sure such profane knowledge might never again be used to mock and defy the will of the gods. But Sotha Sil said to her, \u0022The old gods are cruel and arbitrary, and distant from the hopes and fears of mer. Your age is past. We are the new gods, born of the flesh, and wise and caring of the needs of our people. Spare us your threats and chiding, inconstant spirit. We are bold and fresh, and will not fear you.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then, in that moment, all Chimer were changed into Dunmer, and our skins turned ashen and our eyes into fire. Of course, we only knew at that time that this had happened to us, but Azura said, \u0022This is not my act, but your act. You have chosen your fate, and the fate of your people, and all the Dunmer shall share your fate, from now to the end of time. You think yourselves gods, but you are blind, and all is darkness.\u0022 And Azura left us alone, in darkness, and we were all afraid, but we put on brave faces, and went forth from Red Mountain to build the new world of our dreams.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd the new world we shaped was glorious and generous, and the worship of the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Dunmer\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Dunmer\u0022\u003EDunmer\u003C/a\u003E fervent and grateful. The Dunmer were at first afraid of their new faces, but Sotha Sil spoke to them, saying that it was not a curse but a blessing, a sign of their changed natures, and sign of the special favor they might enjoy as New Mer, no longer barbarians trembling before ghosts and spirits, but civilized mer, speaking directly to their immortal friends and patrons, the three faces of the Tribunal. And we were all inspired by Sotha Sil\u0027s speech and vision, and took heart. And over time, we crafted the customs and institutions of a just and honorable society, and the land of Resdayn knew millennia of peace, equity, and prosperity unknown to other savage races.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut beneath Red Mountain, Dagoth Ur had survived. And even as the light of our bold new world shined ever more brightly, beneath Red Mountain, the darkness gathered, a darkness that was close kin to the bright light that Sotha Sil coaxed from the Heart of Lorkhan with the Tools of Kagrenac. As the darkness grew, we fought it, and crafted walls to confine it, but we never could destroy it, for the source of the darkness was the same source as the source of our own divine inspiration.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd in these latter days of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Morrowind\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Morrowind\u0022\u003EMorrowind\u003C/a\u003E, reduced to a subjugated province of the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Third_Empire\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Third Empire\u0022\u003EWestern Empire\u003C/a\u003E, as the glory of the Temple fades, and the dark tide rises from Red Mountain, we are reminded of Azura and her promised champion\u0027s return. We have waited, blind, and in darkness, mere shadows, drained of our ardent vision, in shame of our folly, in fear of our judgement, and in hope of our deliverance. We do not know if the outlander claiming to fulfill the prophecies of the Nerevarine is our old companion Nerevar reborn, or a pawn of the Emperor, or a catspaw of Azura, or some simple twist of fate.

It seemed inconceivable what my instinct told me: that the two noble old ladies, Lady Villea and the Duchess of Woda, had arranged for a village and school that irritated them to be reduced to ashes. At dinner, they mentioned the fire in Moliva only very briefly, as if it were not news at all. But I did see the Duchess smile for the first time ever. It was a smile I will never forget until the day I die.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe next morning, I had resolved to go to the village and see if I could be of any assistance to the survivors. I was passing through the servants\u0027 hall to the grand foyer when I heard the sound of a group of people ahead. The guards and most of the servants were there, pointing at the portrait of the Duchess that hung in the center of the hall.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was a single black bolt of ebony piercing the painting, right at the Duchess\u0027s heart.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI recognized it at once.

My second reaction was echoed by all present in the hall. How had the vandal gotten past the guards, the gate, the moat, and the massive iron door?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Duchess, arriving shortly after I, was clearly furious, though she was too well bred to show it but by raising her web-thin eyebrows. She wasted no time in assigning all her servants to new duties to keep the palace grounds guarded at all times. We were given regular shifts and precise, narrow patrols.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe next morning, despite all precautions, there was another black arrow piercing the Duchess\u0027s portrait.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo it continued for a week\u0027s time. The Duchess saw to it that at least one person was always present in the foyer, but somehow the arrow always found its way to her painting whenever the guard\u0027s eyes were momentarily averted.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA complex series of signals were devised, so each patrol could report back any sounds or disturbances they encountered during their vigil. At first, the Duchess arranged them so her castellan would receive record of any disturbances during the day, and the chief of the guard during the night. But when she found that she could not sleep, she made certain that the information came to her directly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe atmosphere in the palace had shifted from gloomy to nightmarish. A snake would slither across the moat, and suddenly Her Grace would be tearing through the east wing to investigate.

I don\u0027t know if you\u0027ve had the experience of watching one object relentlessly, but it has a strange effect. All other senses vanish. That was why I was particularly startled when the Duchess rushed into the room, blurring the gulf for me between her portrait and herself.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022There\u0027s something moving behind the tree across the road from the gate!\u0022 she roared, pushing me aside, and fumbling with her key in the gold lock.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EShe was shaking with madness and excitement, and the key did not seem to want to go in.

He was happy to hear that, but I could not find a way to ask him what I really wanted to know. I felt like a fool just wondering if what I thought were true, that he had been behind Prolyssa\u0027s tree across the road from the gate every morning that summer, firing an arrow through the gate, across the lawn, across the moat, through a keyhole, and into a portrait of the Duchess of Woda until he struck the Duchess herself. It was clearly an impossibility.

The \u0027Schools\u0027 of magicka are, as we know, artificial constructs, originally formulated by Vanus Galerion to divide and thereby simplify study. They have changed many times throughout the years, but at their heart, every Master knows, they are all linked together.

When a student of Enchantment uses a trapped soul, he too may be considered guilty of a Black Art. The School of Mysticism, as I have stated before, has some kinship with Necromancy as well. To state that students may not learn the ways of Necromancy is to stifle common skills in the other, more historically legitimate Schools of the Guild.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECounter-Argument by Master Karlyss: Yes, the Schools are intertwined, but the standard spells of each School have passed the proof of time. We know that a student of Mysticism, properly instructed, will not be permanently harmed by his experience. In many ways, it is a question of extremes - how far we would permit our studies to take us. Necromancy by its nature relies on the practitioner going further into the darkness than is wise, virtually guaranteeing his destruction. It has no place in the Mages Guild.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cspan class=\u0022mw-headline\u0022 id=\u0022CONCLUSION\u0022\u003ECONCLUSION\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe risks of studying Necromancy outweigh its usefulness.

They were quite a fearsome sight you can imagine: a horde of wild-eyed men and women with dagger-like teeth filed to tear flesh, wielding massive clubs, cloaked only in the skins of their victims.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EArslic Oan assumed that if he ignored them, they\u0027d go away.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, the first thing that the Nords did was to poison the stream that carried water into the walled stronghold. All the livestock and most of the slaves died very quickly before this was discovered. There was no hope of rescue, at least for several months when the king\u0027s emissaries would come reluctantly to visit the disagreeable vassal. The next closest source of water was on the other side of the hill, so Arslic Oan sent three of his slaves with empty jugs to bring some back.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey were beaten with clubs and eaten before they were a few feet outside the stronghold gates. The next group he sent through he gave sticks to defend themselves. They made it a few feet farther, but were also overwhelmed, beaten, and devoured. It was obvious that better personal defensive was required. Arslic Oan went to talk to his armorer, one of his few slaves with specific talents and duties.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The slaves need armor if they\u0027re going to make it to the river and back,\u0022 he said. \u0022Collect every scrap of steel and iron you can find, every hinge, knife, ring, cup, everything that isn\u0027t needed to keep the walls sturdy, smelt it, and give me the most and the best armor you can, very, very quickly.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe armorer, whose name was Gorkith, was used to Arslic Oan\u0027s demands, and knew that there could be no compromise on the quality and quantity of the armor, or the speed at which he worked. He labored for thirty hours without a break - and, recall, without any water to slake his thirst as he struggled with the kiln and anvil - until finally, he had six suits of mixed-metal armor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESix slaves were chosen, clad in the armor, and sent with jars to collect river water. At first, the mission progressed well. The Nord attacked the armored slaves with their clubs, but they continued their march forward, warding off the blows. Gradually, however, the slaves seemed to be walking uncertainly, dazed by the endless barrage. Eventually, one by one, they fell, the armor was peeled from their bodies, and they were eaten.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The slaves couldn\u0027t move quickly enough in that heavy armor you made,\u0022 said Arslic Oan to Gorkith. \u0022I need you to collect all the cadavers of the poisoned livestock, strip their skin, and give me the most and the best leather armor you can, very, very quickly.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGorklith did as he was told, though it was a particularly repulsive task given the rancid state of the livestock. Normally it takes quite a time to treat and cure leather, so I understand, but Gorklith worked at it tirelessly, and in a half a day he had twelve suits of leather armor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETwelve slaves were chosen, clad in the armor, and sent with jars to collect river water. They progressed, at first, much better than the earlier expedition. Two fell almost immediately, but the others had some luck out-maneuvering their assailants while deflecting an occasional blow of the club. Several got to the river, three were able to fill up their jars, and one fellow very nearly made it back to the stronghold gates. Alas, he fell and was eaten. The Nords possessed a remarkably healthy appetite.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What we need before I completely run out of slaves,\u0022 said Arslic Oan thoughtfully to Gorkith. \u0022Is an armor sturdier than leather but lighter than metal.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe armorer had already considered that and taken stock of the materials available. He had thought about doing something with stone or wood, but there were practical problems with demolishing more of the stronghold. The next most prevalent stuff present in the stronghold was skinned dead bodies, hunks of muscle, fat, blood, and bone. For six hours, he toiled relentlessly until he produced eighteen suits of bonemold, the first ones ever created. Arslic Oan was somewhat dubious at the sight (and smell) but he was very thirsty, and willing to sacrifice another eighteen slaves if necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Might I suggest,\u0022 Gorklith queried tremulously, \u0022Having the slaves practice moving about in the armor, here in the courtyard, before sending them to face the Nords?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EArslic Oan coolly allowed it, and for a few hours, the slaves wandered about the stronghold courtyard in their suits of bonemold. They grew used to the give of the joints, the rigidity of the backplate, the weight pushed onto their shoulders and hips. They discovered how to plant their feet slightly askew to keep their balance steady; how to quickly turn, pivoting without falling down; how to break into a run and stop quickly. By the time they were sent out of the castle gates, they were easily very nearly almost amateurs in the use of their medium weight armor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESeventeen of them were killed and eaten, but one made it back with a jar of water.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s perfect nonsense,\u0022 said Xiomara. \u0022But my point is still valid even so. Like all great inventors, even in fiction, the armorer worked diligently to create the bonemold.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I think there was a good deal of happenstance as well,\u0022 frowned Garaz. \u0022But it is an appalling story.

It was hardly enough to sustain health and well-being. Another expedition was necessary, but they had only one suit of bonemold left, as there was only one survivor of the trip.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022One out of eighteen slaves made it through the gauntlet of Nords wearing that marvelous bonemold armor of yours,\u0022 said Arslic Oan to Gorkith. \u0022And one can only carry back enough water for one. Therefore, mathematically, as we have, counting you and me, fifty-six remaining people at the stronghold, we need armor for fifty-four. Since we already have one, you only need to make fifty-three to make the total. That way, three will make it back, with enough water for you and me and whoever\u0027s in the best condition to partake.

Without prompting, he ordered the slaves to practice using the armor, and even allowed them more training time than their predecessors. They not only learned how to move and stop quickly in bonemold, but how to adjust their peripheral vision to see a blow before it came, and to sway to dodge, and where the sturdiest reinforcement points on the arm were -- the center of the chest and the abdomen -- and how to position themselves to take blows there, against their natural instincts. The slaves even had time for a mock battle before being sent out among the cannibals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe slaves handled themselves admirably. Very few, just fifteen slaves, were killed and eaten out right. Only ten were killed and eaten when they reached the river. That was when things did not go according to Arslic Oan\u0027s plans. Twenty-one slaves with jars of water took off for the hills. Only eight returned to the castle, largely because they were blocked by the cannibal Nords. It was a larger percentage than he had anticipated surviving, but Arslic Oan felt righteous indignation at the paucity of loyalty.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Are you absolutely certain you wouldn\u0027t rather flee?\u0022 he hollered from the battlements.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, he allowed the survivors in. Three had been killed waiting for the gate to open. Two more died almost upon stepping into the courtyard. One was delirious, walking around in circles, laughing and dancing before suddenly collapsing. That meant five jars of water for four people, the two surviving slaves, Arslic Oan, and Gorkith. As the lord of the manor, Arslic Oan took the extra jar, but he was democratic with the others.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027re quite correct,\u0022 frowned Garaz. \u0022This story is getting more and more appalling.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Just wait,\u0022 smiled Hallgerd.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe next morning (Hallgerd continued) Arslic Oan awoke to a perfectly still and quiet stronghold. There was no murmuring in the corridors, no sound of hard labor in the courtyard. He dressed and surveyed the scene. It appeared that the fortress was utterly deserted. Arslic Oan walked down to the armorer\u0027s quarters, but the door was locked.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Open up,\u0022 said Arslic Oan, patiently. \u0022We need to speak. Thirty out of fifty-four slaves successfully made it to the river and gathered water. Admittedly, some then fled, and a couple didn\u0027t survive because I needed to correct their fickleness, but mathematically, that\u0027s a fifty-five percent survival rate.

He practiced in the courtyard, impressing himself with his natural comfortably with medium weight armor. For hours, he boxed, feinted, dodged, sprinted, skipped, jumped, and generally cavorted about. When he felt tired, he retired to the shade and took a nap.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe sound of the king\u0027s trumpet woke him with a start. Night had fallen, and for a moment, he thought he had been dreaming. Then the alarum sounded again, far in the distance, but clear. Arslic Oan leapt to his feet and ran to the ramparts. Several miles away, he could see the emissaries and their vast and well-armed escort approach. They were there early! The cannibal Nords below looked at one another with consternation. Savages they might be, but they knew when a superior force was approaching.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EArslic Oan joyously dashed down the stairs to Gorklith\u0027s chamber. The door was still locked. He beat on it, cajoling, demanding, threatening. Finally, he found a key, one of the few scraps of metal that had not been smelted days before.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGorklith appeared to be sleeping, but as Arslic Oan approached, he noticed that the armorer\u0027s mouth and eyes were wide open and his arms were folded unnaturally behind his back. On closer inspection, the armorer was obviously dead. What was more, his face and whole body were sunken, like an empty pig\u0027s bladder.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESomething moved through the walls, like a footfall only... squishy. Arslic Oan expertly and gracefully turned to face it, completely in balance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt first, it seemed like nothing more than a bubble expanding through one of the cracks in the stone. As more of the flesh-colored gelatinous matter emerged, it more clearly resembled part of a face. A flaccid, almost shapeless face with a low brow and a slack, toothless jaw. The rest of the body oozed out of the crack, a soft bag of muscle and blood. Behind Arslic Oan and to the side, there was more movement, more slaves welling up through the cracks in the stone.

All that we can say is that it is both, and neither - a divine mystery.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe line of Septims have all been Dragonborn, of course, which is one reason the simplistic notion of it being hereditary has become so commonplace. But we know for certain that the early Cyrodilic rulers were not all related. There is also no evidence that Reman Cyrodiil was descended from Alessia, although there are many legends that would make it so, most of them dating from the time of Reman and likely attempts to legitimize his rule. We know that the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Blades\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Blades\u0022\u003EBlades\u003C/a\u003E, usually thought of as the Emperor\u0027s bodyguards, originated in \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Akavir\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Akavir\u0022\u003EAkavir\u003C/a\u003Ei crusaders who invaded \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Tamriel\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Tamriel\u0022\u003ETamriel\u003C/a\u003E for obscure reasons in the late \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:First_Era\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:First Era\u0022\u003EFirst Era\u003C/a\u003E. They appear to have been searching for a Dragonborn - the events at \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Pale_Pass\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Pale Pass\u0022\u003EPale Pass\u003C/a\u003E bear this out - and the Akaviri were the first to proclaim Reman Cyrodiil as Dragonborn. In fact it was the Akaviri who did the most to promote his standing as Emperor (although Reman himself never took that title in his lifetime). And of course there is no known hereditary connection between Tiber Septim and any of the previous Dragonborn rulers of Tamriel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether there can be more than one Dragonborn at any time is another mystery. The Emperors have done their best to dismiss this notion, but of course the Imperial succession itself means that at the very least there are two or more potential Dragonborn at any time: the current ruler and his or her heirs. The history of the Blades also hints at this - although little is known of their activities during the Interregnum between \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Second_Empire\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Second Empire\u0022\u003EReman\u0027s Empire\u003C/a\u003E and the rise of Tiber Septim, many believe that the Blades continued to search out and guard those they believed were (or might be) Dragonborn during this time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELastly, we come to the question of the true meaning of being Dragonborn. The connection with dragons is so obvious that it has almost been forgotten - in these days when dragons are a distant memory, we forget that in the early days being Dragonborn meant having \u0022the dragon blood\u0022. Some scholars believe that was meant quite literally, although the exact significance is not known. The Nords tell tales of Dragonborn heroes who were great dragonslayers, able to steal the power of the dragons they killed. Indeed, it is well known that the Akaviri sought out and killed many dragons during their invasion, and there is some evidence that this continued after they became Reman Cyrodiil\u0027s Dragonguard (again, the connection to dragons) - the direct predecessor to the Blades of today.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI leave you with what is known as \u0022The Prophecy of the Dragonborn\u0022. It often said to originate in an \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Elder_Scroll\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Elder Scroll\u0022\u003EElder Scroll\u003C/a\u003E, although it is sometimes also attributed to the ancient Akaviri. Many have attempted to decipher it, and many have also believed that its omens had been fulfilled and that the advent of the \u0022Last Dragonborn\u0022 was at hand. I make no claims as an interpreter of prophecy, but it does suggest that the true significance of Akatosh\u0027s gift to mortalkind has yet to be fully understood.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp align=\u0022left\u0022\u003EWhen \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Imperial_Simulacrum\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Imperial Simulacrum\u0022\u003Emisrule\u003C/a\u003E takes its place at the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Staff_of_Chaos\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Staff of Chaos\u0022\u003Eeight corners\u003C/a\u003E of the world\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp align=\u0022left\u0022\u003EWhen the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Anumidium\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Anumidium\u0022\u003EBrass Tower\u003C/a\u003E walks and \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Warp_in_the_West\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Warp in the West\u0022\u003ETime is reshaped\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp align=\u0022left\u0022\u003EWhen the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Tribunal\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Tribunal\u0022\u003Ethrice-blessed\u003C/a\u003E fail and the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Red_Mountain\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Red Mountain\u0022\u003ERed Tower\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Red_Year\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Red Year\u0022\u003Etrembles\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp align=\u0022left\u0022\u003EWhen the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Septim_Dynasty\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Septim Dynasty\u0022\u003EDragonborn Ruler\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Oblivion_Crisis\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Oblivion Crisis\u0022\u003Eloses his throne\u003C/a\u003E, and the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:White-Gold_Tower\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:White-Gold Tower\u0022\u003EWhite Tower\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Great_War\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Great War\u0022\u003Efalls\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp align=\u0022left\u0022\u003EWhen the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Throat_of_the_World\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Throat of the World\u0022\u003ESnow Tower\u003C/a\u003E lies \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Stormcloak_Rebellion\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Stormcloak Rebellion\u0022\u003Esundered, kingless, bleeding\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp align=\u0022left\u0022\u003EThe \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Alduin\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Alduin\u0022\u003EWorld-Eater\u003C/a\u003E wakes, and the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Aurbis\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Aurbis\u0022\u003EWheel\u003C/a\u003E turns upon the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Dovahkiin\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Dovahkiin\u0022\u003ELast Dragonborn\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n","Author":"Prior Emelene Madrine","Description":"A treatise on the Dragonborn","Type":"","CoverImage":"SR-icon-book-BookOfTheDragonborn.png"},{"Id":"xx00FAC2","Title":"The Book of Life and Service","Text":null,"Author":"","Description":"Book relating to the undead of the Soul Cairn","Type":"","CoverImage":"SR-icon-book-BasicBook3.png"},{"Id":"0001B236","Title":"Breathing Water","Text":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022H\u0022 src=\u0022//images.uesp.net/thumb/a/a0/H_letter.png/53px-H_letter.png\u0022 title=\u0022H\u0022 width=\u002253\u0022 height=\u002245\u0022 style=\u0022vertical-align: baseline\u0022 srcset=\u0022//images.uesp.net/thumb/a/a0/H_letter.png/80px-H_letter.png 1.5x, //images.uesp.net/thumb/a/a0/H_letter.png/105px-H_letter.png 2x\u0022\u003Ee walked through the dry, crowded streets of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Bal_Fell\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Bal Fell\u0022\u003EBal Fell\u003C/a\u003E, glad to be among so many strangers.

Likewise, \u0022hot steel.\u0022 What could \u0022walls beyond doors\u0022 mean? Or \u0022two months and back\u0022? What numbered \u0022fifty-three\u0022?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe notion that Ulstyr possessed secret knowledge about her and the tomb they were in began to unnerve Chance. She made up her mind then to abandon her companion once the treasure had been found. He had cut through the living and undead guardians of the dungeon: if she merely left by the path they had entered, she would be safe without a defender.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne phrase he said made perfect sense to her: \u0022drain ring.\u0022 At one of the manors in Balmora, she had picked up a ring purely because she thought it was pretty. It was not until later that she discovered that it could be used to sap other people\u0027s vitality. Could Ulstyr be aware of this? Would he be taken by surprise if she used it on him?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EShe formulated her plan on how best to desert the Breton as they continued down the hall. Abruptly the passage ended with a large metal door, secured by a golden lock. Using her pick, Chance snapped away the two tumblers and bolt, and swung the door open. The treasure of the Heran Tomb was within.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EChance quietly slipped her glove off her hand, exposing the ring as she stepped into the room. There were fifty-three bags of gold within. As she turned, the door closed between her and the Breton. On her side, it did not resemble a door anymore, but a wall. Walls beyond doors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor many days, Chance screamed and screamed, as she tried to find a way out of the room. For some days after that, she listened dully to the laughter of Sheogorath within her own head. Two months later, when Ulstyr returned, she was dead. He used a rock to prop open the door and remove the gold.\u003C/p\u003E\n","Author":"Zylmoc Golge","Description":"The folly of a double-crosser","Type":"","CoverImage":"SR-icon-book-BasicBook6.png"},{"Id":"xx028263","Title":"Changed Ones","Text":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022O\u0022 src=\u0022//images.uesp.net/thumb/d/dd/O_letter.png/51px-O_letter.png\u0022 title=\u0022O\u0022 width=\u002251\u0022 height=\u002245\u0022 style=\u0022vertical-align: baseline\u0022 srcset=\u0022//images.uesp.net/thumb/d/dd/O_letter.png/77px-O_letter.png 1.5x, //images.uesp.net/thumb/d/dd/O_letter.png/102px-O_letter.png 2x\u0022\u003Ef all the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Et%27Ada\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Et\u0027Ada\u0022\u003Eet\u0027Ada\u003C/a\u003E who wandered \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Nirn\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Nirn\u0022\u003ENirn\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Trinimac\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Trinimac\u0022\u003ETrinimac\u003C/a\u003E was the strongest.

I at once ensconced myself in one of the better libraries here, becoming reacquainted with the locals and the lore. At the risk of being overly optimistic, I think I might have struck on something very interesting about this mysterious fellow, Hadwaf Neithwyr.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMany here in town remember him, though few very fondly.

More about that in a moment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe cemetery is actually outside of the city gates, I discovered. The locals warned me to wait until morning to speak to the caretaker, but I was impatient for information, and did not want to waste a moment. I trekked through the woods to the lonely graveyard, and immediately found the shuffling, elderly man who was the caretaker. He bade me leave, that the land was haunted and if I chose to stay I would be in the greatest danger. I told him that I would not go until he told me what he knew about Hadwaf Neithwyr and his patron Baliasir. On hearing their names, he fled deeper into the jumble of broken tombstones and decrepit mausoleums. I naturally pursued.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI saw him scramble down into an enormous crypt and gave chase. There was no light within, but I had planned enough to bring with me a torch. The minute I lit it, I heard a long, savage howl pierce the silence, and I knew that the caretaker had left quickly not merely because he feared speaking of Neithwyr and Baliasir. Before I saw the creature, I heard its heavy breath and the clack of its clawed feet on stone moving closer to me. The \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Werewolf\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Werewolf\u0022\u003Ewerewolf\u003C/a\u003E emerged from the gloom, brown and black, with slavering jaws, looking at me with the eyes of the cemetery caretaker, now given only to animal hunger.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI instantly had three different instinctive reactions. The first was, of course, flight. The second was to fight. But if I fled, I might never find the caretaker again, and learn what he knew. If I fought, I might injure or even kill the creature and be even worse off. So I elected to go with my third option: to hold my ground and keep the creature within its tomb until the night became morning, and the caretaker resumed his humanity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve sparred often enough unarmored, but surely never with so much at stake, and never with so savage an opponent. My mind was always on danger not only of injury but the dread disease of lycanthropy. Every rake of its claw I parried, every snap of its foaming jaws I ducked. I sidestepped when it tried to rush me, but closed the distance to keep it from escaping into the night. For hours we fought, I always on the defense, it always trying to free itself, or slay me, or both. I have no doubt that a werewolf has greater energy reserves than a man, but it is a beast and does not know how to save and temper its movements. As the dawn rose, we were both nearly unconscious from fatigue, but I received my reward. The creature became a man once again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe was quite considerably friendlier than he had been before. In fact, when he realized that I had prevented him from going on his nocturnal rampage through the countryside, he became positively affable.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what I learned: Neithwyr never returned to High Rock.

I visited the gravesite of his sister Peryra, and learned that it was probably through her that Neithwyr first met his patron. It would seem that she was quite a well-known courtesan in her day, and very well traveled, though she chose to return home to die. Unlike Neithwyr, Baliasir is not far away from me. He is a shadowy character, but lately, according to the caretaker, he has been paying court to Queen \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Elysana\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Elysana\u0022\u003EElysana\u003C/a\u003E in \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Wayrest\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Wayrest\u0022\u003EWayrest\u003C/a\u003E.

I told Baliasir quite truthfully that I had never learned any of that (oh, but I wish I knew some healing spells of the school of restoration now), but that I had developed some small skill in mysticism.

Still, I must admit that I held hopes that you would arrive, as you threatened you might in your letter, so I might have someone of physical strength to aid me in my adventure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI am growing weaker and weaker as I write this, so I must proceed with the basic facts. I went to the crypt the following night, and Baliasir led me through the maze of it to the repository where he kept the Star. We were talking quite casually, and as you\u0027ve so often said, it seemed an excellent time for an ambush. I grabbed the Star and unsheathed my blade in what I felt was amazing speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe turned to me and I suddenly felt that I was moving like a snail.

A blue flash of energy coursed through me, flung by Baliasir\u0027s claws. At once, I began to feel death. He could have smote me with a thousand spells, but he chose the one where I could lie down, and suffer, and hear him laugh. At the very least, I did not give him that pleasure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlready struck, it was too late for me to cast a counterspell of mysticism, one to dispel the magicka, reflect it or absorb it as my own. But I did still know how to teleport myself, what mystics term \u0027Recall,\u0027 to whatever place I\u0027d last set a spiritual anchor.

Koniinge replied back that he could find nothing about Baliasir, but believed that Neithwyr had returned to High Rock with Peryra after getting the Star. Charwich\u0027s last letter was a written on his deathbed, having sustained mortal wounds from his battle with Baliasir, who it seemed had been a mighty daedra lord.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKoniinge grieved for his friend, and traveled the span of the Empire to Wayrest, to pay his call of condolences on Lady Moorling, the woman at whose house Charwich had been staying. After making some inquiries, Koniinge learned that her ladyship had left the city, quite suddenly. She had been entertaining a guest named Charwich, and it was understood that he had died, though no one ever saw the body. Certainly no healers had been sent to her house on the 13th of Last Seed of last year.

There was indeed a lycanthropic caretaker, fortunately in human form at the time. When questioned (using the technique of strangulation, release, strangulation, release), he told Koniinge the story that he had told Charwich many months before.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHadwaf and Peryra Neithwyr had returned to Dwynnen, intent on settling old business. As the Star requires potent spirits for power, they thought they would begin small by capturing the spirit of the werewolf they knew of in the family graveyard. Sadly, for them, their grasp exceeded their reach. When the poor caretaker resumed his human form one morning, he found himself lying next to the shredded, bloody bodies of the Neithwyr siblings. Distressed and fearful, he brought the corpses and all their possessions down into the crypt. They were still there when Charwich came, and so too was Azura\u0027s Star.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKoniinge now saw things clearly. The letters he had received from Charwich were lies, intended to keep him away. Undoubtedly with the assistance of Lady Moorling, his new partner, he had concocted stories, including one of his own demise, to trick Koniinge into abandoning the quest for the Star. It was clearly a sad statement on the nature of friendship, and one that needed immediate correction.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt took the better part of six months for Koniinge to find his old partner. Charwich and Lady Moorling had used the power of the Star to make themselves very wealthy and powerful. They assumed a number of different identities in their travels through High Rock and \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Skyrim\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Skyrim\u0022\u003ESkyrim\u003C/a\u003E, and then down to \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Valenwood\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Valenwood\u0022\u003EValenwood\u003C/a\u003E and the Summurset Isle. Along the way, of course, the Star itself disappeared, as great daedric artifacts always do. The couple still had much wealth, but their love sadly fell on troubled times. When they reached \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Alinor_(city)\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Alinor (city)\u0022\u003EAlinor\u003C/a\u003E, they parted ways.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne must assume that during their months together, Charwich must have told Lady Moorling about Koniinge. It\u0027s pleasant to think of the loving couple laughing over the stories they were telling him about the mythical and dangerous Baliasir. Charwich must not have given his former beloved a very accurate physical description, however, because when Lady Moorling (then under the identity of the Countess Zyliana) met Koniinge, she had no idea who he was. It came as quite a surprise to her when he began strangling her and requesting information about her former paramour.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore she died, she told Koniinge what Charwich\u0027s new name and title was, and where he was looking for a new palace. She even told him about me. Given all the twists and bends the last months\u0027 chase took him on, it was not difficult to find which palace Charwich was looking to buy, and what time his appointment was to view it. Then he had merely to arrive early, dispose of me, and wait.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere our story must sadly end.

When I mentioned the name to the priest he nodded frantically, but I could see that the interrogation had reached an ending. There is, after all, something about being throttled that causes a man to answer yes to every question. I snapped Minerath\u0027s neck, and returned home.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo now I\u0027m again unsure how to proceed.

We had to get rid of all the heavy armor they brought to us and find enough traditional armor our troops felt comfortable wearing.

It seems strange to say, but one of the best features of traditional armor is that an arrow will either deflect completely or pass all the way through. An arrow head is like a hook, made to stick where it strikes if it doesn\u0027t pass through. A soldier in traditional armor will find himself with a hole in his body and the bolt on the other side. Our healers can fix such a wound easily if it isn\u0027t fatal, but if the arrow still remains in the armor, as it does with heavier armor, the wound will be reopened every time the fellow moves. Unless the Khajiit strips off the armor and pulls out the arrow, which is what we had to do at the Battle of Zelinin.

They welcomed me into their homes, one and all, without the slightest hint of suspicion or uncertainty. Trust, it seems, comes readily to the Skaal.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn appearance, the Skaal are clearly of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Nord\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Nord\u0022\u003ENord\u003C/a\u003E ancestry. However, they are culturally distinct in several significant ways, the most notable of which is their faith. Having never adopted the pantheon of the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Empire\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Empire\u0022\u003EEmpire\u003C/a\u003E, the Skaal recognize only a single deity whom they call the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:All-Maker\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:All-Maker\u0022\u003EAll-Maker\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor the Skaal, the All-Maker is the source of all life and creation. When a creature dies, its spirit returns to the All-Maker, who shapes it into something new and returns it to \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Mundus\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Mundus\u0022\u003EMundus\u003C/a\u003E. The concept of death as an ending to life is unknown to the Skaal. Rather, death is seen as simply the beginning of the next stage of an endless journey.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis great respect for life is evident in one of the most important Skaal beliefs, a concept the villagers call \u0022one-ness with the land\u0022. The Skaal try to live in harmony with their surroundings, making as small an impact on their environment as possible. When a Skaal villager sets out to collect firewood, for example, he or she takes it from fallen, dead trees. When the Skaal hunt, it is only out of necessity, and not for sport. Because they hold all life in great reverence, the Skaal people will resort to violence only as a last resort.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis has understandably led to a rather austere lifestyle for these simple, good-natured folk. For the Skaal, the word \u0022luxury\u0022 is nearly an alien concept, though I was intrigued to note that one villager, \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Edla\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Edla\u0022\u003EEdla\u003C/a\u003E, has taken to trading basic goods with travelers who pass through the village in exchange for small luxury items. Such an enterprising outlook is something of a novelty for the Skaal.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThough it saddens me to conclude this account on such a somber note, it is impossible to deny the hard truth that the Skaal people are dwindling. In a century or two, it is possible that their unique way of life will be lost to the world forever, reduced to little more than a footnote in the great epoch of history.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis comes as little surprise, given the immense hardships of a life lived in such an extreme environment. For the Skaal, it is a daily struggle to survive the perpetual wintry climate of northern Solstheim, but other challenges have recently appeared.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe ashfall from \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Vvardenfell\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Vvardenfell\u0022\u003EVvardenfell\u003C/a\u003E has taken its toll on the plants and animals upon which the Skaal depend for their survival, and life is now a struggle for all who call Solstheim home.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTherefore, I humbly beseech any students of history who might encounter this modest text to travel to Solstheim and learn all that can be learned of this noble people and their ancient customs.

In the interests of keeping some measure of peace in the Land, Sthovin the Warlord agreed to a truce with Karenithil Barif the Beast.

Its agility was such that few of the bolts struck it. It had the wherewithal to pivot on its hips to avoid the brunt of the attacks without losing its balance, feet firmly planted on the ground.

The part with the big river running through it is called the Riverside, and the other is called the Dryside. The Riverside is where the smelter and native workers live, so don\u0027t bother going there.

But it\u0027s also the jail. Markarth uses prisoners to mine the ore, and there\u0027s a lot of it, so don\u0027t get caught doing something illegal in the city or you\u0027ll be hauled down there to dig.

I tried meeting with the head of the Silver-Blood family to see if they had any work, but guarding their mines isn\u0027t the blood-rush I become a mercenary for. Something to keep in mind for yourself if you\u0027re thinking of staying a few months.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe final place I\u0027ll talk about here is \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Understone_Keep\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Understone Keep\u0022\u003EUnderstone Keep\u003C/a\u003E, the home of the Jarl in Markarth. It\u0027s a fancy palace like any other (assuming your palace is built underground), but what you need to know is the city underneath the keep. That\u0027s right, there\u0027s another city below Markarth. One of those old dwarven ruins. They sometimes have expeditions in the ruins that makes for a good job, guarding the scholars and maybe lifting a few stones here and there. If you\u0027re lucky, you might come across one of those old dwarven machines, and you can bring back a souvenir after you\u0027re done breaking it apart.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAll right, Ms. Alleia\u0027s hand is getting tired and that means this guide is done. Last piece of advice, don\u0027t cause trouble in Markarth. Don\u0027t start fights. Don\u0027t stop fights. Don\u0027t stick your head anywhere without someone from the city paying you for it, because believe me, no one in Markarth wants you there. Make your gold, drink your mead, see what\u0027s there to see, and move on.

The Orc Strongholds have existed as long as the Orc race has, according to them. They\u0027re armored camps in the least, and fortresses at the most. Every man, woman, and child inside the walls is trained from birth to defend it. All their weapons and armor are smithed right there in the stronghold, all the food is hunted down by Orc warriors and brought back to be eaten by everyone who lives there.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey follow no laws, save their own, an unwritten set of rules called \u0022The \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Code_of_Malacath\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Code of Malacath\u0022\u003ECode of Malacath\u003C/a\u003E,\u0022 named after one of their \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Gods\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Gods\u0022\u003Egods\u003C/a\u003E, who is sometimes called \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Mauloch\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Mauloch\u0022\u003EMauloch\u003C/a\u003E. Most of it\u0027s pretty simple, don\u0027t steal, don\u0027t kill, don\u0027t attack people for no reason (although there seems to be a big list of exceptions). But Orcs in the stronghold don\u0027t have jails for their criminals. They have Blood Price. You either pay enough in goods for your crimes, or you bleed enough that the victim is satisfied. And Orcs, I don\u0027t need to tell you, have a lot of blood.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Code also sets up who runs the stronghold. The toughest male is usually the Chief and makes decisions and decides when the Code of Malacath has been satisfied. All the women are either the Chief\u0027s wives or his daughters, with the exception of the wise woman, who handles all the spiritual matters and healing needs. Matters of grave dispute are handled with short but violent fights, and those who don\u0027t get along with the Chief are usually forced out of the stronghold to live among the rest of us. An Orc grows up being told to fight for everything, that if something is not worth fighting for it is beneath the Code.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOrc Strongholds don\u0027t like strangers, used to living on their own like they do. Ms. Alleia knows what she does because so many Orcs leave the strongholds to become sellswords or soldiers, and a few pints of mead gets them talking about home. I hear that sometimes an Orc will make a non-Orc a \u0022Blood-Kin\u0022 and that person is then allowed to live in the stronghold as one of the clan, but I\u0027ve never heard of that actually happening.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor all their strange rules and traditions, the Code of Malacath does breed a culture of determined warriors. They\u0027re focused in ways that the average sellsword isn\u0027t.

The origin of the Wood Elf aversion to cutting their own wood or eating any plant material at all, yet paradoxically their willingness to import plantstuff from other cultures, I feel can be linked to a passage in the Mnoriad,\u0022 Mallon shuffled through some of his papers, searching for the appropriate text.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo Scotti\u0027s vast relief, the carriage soon stopped to camp for the night. They were high on a bluff over a gray stream, and before them was the great valley of Valenwood. Only the cry of seabirds declared the presence of the ocean to the bay to the west: here the timber was so tall and wide, twisting around itself like an impossible knot begun eons ago, to be impenetrable. A few more modest trees, only fifty feet to the lowest branches, stood on the cliff at the edge of camp. The sight was so alien to Scotti and he found himself so anxious about the proposition of entering the wilderness that he could not imagine sleeping.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, Mallon had supposed he had found another academic with a passion for the riddles of ancient cultures. Long into the night, he recited Bosmer verse in the original and in his own translation, sobbing and bellowing and whispering wherever appropriate.

I\u0027m a representative for an important Imperial agency, the Atrius Building Commission, here to help repair and alleviate some of the problems the war with the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Khajiit\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Khajiit\u0022\u003EKhajiit\u003C/a\u003E brought to your province.

Not even enough for a decent room when I get to Falinesti. I really would help you if I could,\u0022 said Scotti, persuading himself that it was true.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe band of six and their Bosmer escorts began the descent down a rocky path along the bluff. Within an hour\u0027s time, they were deep in the jungles of Valenwood. A never-ending canopy of hues of browns and greens obscured the sky. A millennia\u0027s worth of fallen leaves formed a deep, wormy sea of putrefaction beneath their feet. Several miles were crossed wading through the slime. For several more, they took a labyrinthian path across fallen branches and the low-hanging boughs of giant trees.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAll the while, hour after hour, the inexhaustible Bosmer host moved so fast, the Cyrodiils struggled to keep from being left behind. A red-faced little merchant with short legs took a bad step on a rotten branch and nearly fell. His fellow provincials had to help him up. The Bosmer paused only a moment, their eyes continually darting to the shadows in the trees above before moving on at their usual expeditious pace.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What are they so nervous about?\u0022 wheezed the merchant irritably. \u0022More Cathay-Raht?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Don\u0027t be ridiculous,\u0022 laughed the Bosmer unconvincingly. \u0022Khajiit this far into Valenwood?

He was used to four meals a day in the Cyrodilic custom. Hours of nonstop exertion without food was not part of his regimen as a comfortably paid clerk. He pondered, feeling somewhat delirious, how long they had been trotting through the jungle. Twelve hours? Twenty? A week? Time was meaningless. Sunlight was only sporadic through the vegetative ceiling. Phosphorescent molds on the trees and in the muck below provided the only regular illumination.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Is it at all possible for us to rest and eat?\u0022 he hollered to his host up ahead.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We\u0027re near to Falinesti,\u0022 came the echoing reply. \u0022Lots of food there.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe path continued upward for several hours more across a clot of fallen logs, rising up to the first and then the second boughs of the tree line. As they rounded a long corner, the travelers found themselves midway up a waterfall that fell a hundred feet or more. No one had the energy to complain as they began pulling up the stacks of rock, agonizing foot by foot. The Bosmer escorts disappeared into the mist, but Scotti kept climbing until there was no more rock left. He wiped the sweat and river water from his eyes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFalinesti spread across the horizon before him. Sprawling across both banks of the river stood the mighty graht-oak city, with groves and orchards of lesser trees crowding it like supplicants before their king. At a lesser scale, the tree that formed the moving city would have been extraordinary: gnarled and twisted with a gorgeous crown of gold and green, dripping with vines and shining with sap. At a mile tall and half as wide, it was the most magnificent thing Scotti had ever seen. If he had not been a starving man with the soul of a clerk, he would have sung.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022There you are,\u0022 said the leader of the escorts. \u0022Not too far a walk.

The sight of the vertical metropolis where people moved about like ants disoriented all his sensibilities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You wouldn\u0027t know of an inn called,\u0022 he paused for a moment, and then pulled Jurus\u0027s letter from his pocket. \u0022Something like \u0027Mother Paskos Tavern\u0027?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Mother Pascost?\u0022 the lead Bosmer laughed his familiar contemptuous laugh. \u0022You won\u0027t want to stay there? Visitors always prefer the Aysia Hall in the top boughs. It\u0027s expensive, but very nice.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m meeting someone at Mother Pascost\u0027s Tavern.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022If you\u0027ve made up your mind to go, take a lift to Havel Slump and ask for directions there.

The ground was littered with leaves and refuse, and from moment to moment a glass or a bone would plummet from far above, so he walked with his neck crooked to have warning. An intricate network of platforms anchored to thick vines slipped up and down the slick trunk of the city with perfect grace, manned by operators with arms as thick as an ox\u0027s belly.

Curled webs of moss stretched unevenly across the fork, forming a sharing roof for several dozen small buildings. There were only a few souls in the alley, but around the bend ahead, he could hear the sound of music and people. Scotti tipped the Falinesti Platform Ferryman a gold piece and asked for the location of Mother Pascost\u0027s Tavern.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Straight ahead of you, sir, but you won\u0027t find anyone there,\u0022 the Ferryman explained, pointing in the direction of the noise. \u0022Morndas everyone in Havel Slump has revelry.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EScotti walked carefully along the narrow street. Though the ground felt as solid as the marble avenues of the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Imperial_City\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Imperial City\u0022\u003EImperial City\u003C/a\u003E, there were slick cracks in the bark that exposed fatal drops into the river. He took a moment to sit down, to rest and get used to the view from the heights. It was a beautiful day for certain, but it took Scotti only a few minutes of contemplation to rise up in alarm. A jolly little raft anchored down stream below him had distinctly moved several inches while he watched it. But it hadn\u0027t moved at all. He had. Together with everything around him. It was no metaphor: the city of Falinesti walked. And, considering its size, it moved quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EScotti rose to his feet and into a cloud of smoke that drifted out from around the bend. It was the most delicious roast he had ever smelled. The clerk forgot his fear and ran.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022revelry\u0022 as the Ferryman had termed it took place on an enormous platform tied to the tree, wide enough to be a plaza in any other city. A fantastic assortment of the most amazing people Scotti had ever seen were jammed shoulder-to-shoulder together, many eating, many more drinking, and some dancing to a lutist and singer perched on an offshoot above the crowd. They were largely Bosmer, true natives clad in colorful leather and bones, with a close minority of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Orc\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Orc\u0022\u003Eorc\u003C/a\u003Es. Whirling through the throng, dancing and bellowing at one another were a hideous ape people. A few heads bobbing over the tops of the crowd belonged not, as Scotti first assumed, to very tall people, but to a family of centaurs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Care for some mutton?\u0022 queried a wizened old mer who roasted an enormous beast on some red-hot rocks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EScotti quickly paid him a gold piece and devoured the leg he was given. And then another gold piece and another leg. The fellow chuckled when Scotti began choking on a piece of gristle, and handed him a mug of a frothing white drink. He drank it and felt a quiver run through his body as if he were being tickled.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What is that?\u0022 Scotti asked.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jagga. Fermented pig\u0027s milk. I can let you have a flagon of it and a bit more mutton for another gold.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EScotti agreed, paid, gobbled down the meat, and took the flagon with him as he slipped into the crowd. His co-worker Liodes Jurus, the man who had told him to come to Valenwood, was nowhere to be seen. When the flagon was a quarter empty, Scotti stopped looking for Jurus. When it was half empty, he was dancing with the group, oblivious to the broken planks and gaps in the fencework. At three quarters empty, he was trading jokes with a group of creatures whose language was completely alien to him. By the time the flagon was completely drained, he was asleep, snoring, while the revelry continued on all around his supine body.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe next morning, still asleep, Scotti had the sensation of someone kissing him. He made a face to return the favor, but a pain like fire spread through his chest and forced him to open his eyes. There was an insect the size of a large calf sitting on him, crushing him, its spiky legs holding him down while a central spiral-bladed vortex of a mouth tore through his shirt. He screamed and thrashed but the beast was too strong. It had found its meal and it was going to finish it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s over, thought Scotti wildly, I should have never left home. I could have stayed in the City, and perhaps found work with Lord Vanech. I could have begun again as a junior clerk and worked my way back up.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly the mouth released itself. The creature shivered once, expelled a burst of yellow bile, and died.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Got one!\u0022 cried a voice, not too distantly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor a moment, Scotti lay still. His head throbbed and his chest burned. Out of the corner of his eye he saw movement. Another of the horrible monsters was scurried towards him. He scrambled, trying to push himself free, but before he could come out, there was a sound of a bow cracking and an arrow pierced the second insect.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Good shot!\u0022 cried another voice. \u0022Get the first one again! I just saw it move a little!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis time, Scotti felt the impact of the bolt hit the carcass. He cried out, but he could hear how muffled his voice was by the beetle\u0027s body. Cautiously, he tried sliding a foot out and rolling under, but the movement apparently had the effect of convincing the archers that the creature still lived. A volley of arrows was launched forth. Now the beast was sufficiently perforated so pools of its blood, and likely the blood of its victims, began to seep out onto Scotti\u0027s body.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen Scotti was a lad, before he grew too sophisticated for such sports, he had often gone to the Imperial Arena for the competitions of war. He recalled a great veteran of the fights, when asked, telling him his secret, \u0022Whenever I\u0027m in doubt of what to do, and I have a shield, I stay behind it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EScotti followed that advice. After an hour, when he no longer heard arrows being fired, he threw aside the remains of the bug and leapt as quickly as he could to a stand. It was not a moment too soon. A gang of eight archers had their bows pointing his direction, ready to fire. When they saw him, they laughed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Didn\u0027t anyone ever tell you not to sleep in the western cross?

As they drifted around the bend, they next saw the flames, and then the blackened skeletal remains of the village. Dying, blazing villagers leapt from rocks into the river. A cacophony of wailing met their ears, and they could see, roaming along the edges of the town, the figures of Khajiiti soldiers bearing torches.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Baan Dar bless me!\u0022 slurred the captain. \u0022The war\u0027s back on!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh, no,\u0022 whimpered Scotti.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe sloop drifted with the current toward the opposite shore away from the fiery town. Scotti turned his attention there, and the sanctuary it offered. Just a peaceful arbor, away from the horror. There was a shudder of leaves in two of the trees and a dozen lithe Khajiit dropped to the ground, armed with bows.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022They see us,\u0022 hissed Scotti. \u0022And they\u0027ve got bows!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, of course they have bows,\u0022 snarled Captain Balfix. \u0022We Bosmer may have invented the bloody things, but we didn\u0027t think to keep them secret, you bloody bureaucrat.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Now, they\u0027re setting their arrows on fire!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, they do that sometimes.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Captain, they\u0027re shooting at us!

Even worse, the second volley of arrows hit the supply of pitch, which ignited in a tremendous blue blaze. Scotti grabbed Captain Balfix and they leapt overboard just before the ship and all its cargo disintegrated. The shock of the cold water brought the Bosmer into temporary sobriety. He called to Scotti, who was already swimming as fast as he could toward the bend.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Master Decumus, where do you think you\u0027re swimming to?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Back to Falinesti!\u0022 cried Scotti.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It will take you days, and by the time you get there, everyone will know about the attack on Athay!

He thanked \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Mara\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Mara\u0022\u003EMara\u003C/a\u003E that he had learned to swim.

Even in wintertide, the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Xylo_River\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Xylo River\u0022\u003EXylo River\u003C/a\u003E was fairly temperate and after a fashion, even comfortable. The Bosmer\u0027s strokes were uneven, and he\u0027d stray closer to Scotti and then further away, pushing ahead and then falling behind.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EScotti looked to the shore to his right: the flames had caught the trees like tinder. Behind them was an inferno, with which they were barely keeping pace. To the shore on their left, all looked fair, until he saw a tremble in the river-reeds, and then what caused it. A pride of the largest cats he had ever seen. They were auburn-haired, green-eyed beasts with jaws and teeth to match his wildest nightmares. And they were watching the two swimmers, and keeping pace.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Captain Balfix, we can\u0027t go to either that shore or the other one, or we\u0027ll be parboiled or eaten,\u0022 Scotti whispered. \u0022Try to even your kicking and your strokes. Breath like you would normally. If you\u0027re feeling tired, tell me, and we\u0027ll float on our backs for a while.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone who has had the experience of giving rational advice to a drunkard would understand the hopelessness. Scotti kept pace with the captain, slowing himself, quickening, drifting left and right, while the Bosmer moaned old ditties from his pirate days. When he wasn\u0027t watching his companion, he watched the cats on the shore. After a stretch, he turned to his right. Another village had caught fire. Undoubtedly, it was Grenos. Scotti stared at the blazing fury, awed by the sight of the destruction, and did not hear that the captain had ceased to sing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen he turned back, Captain Balfix was gone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EScotti dove into the murky depths of the river over and over again. There was nothing to be done. When he surfaced after his final search, he saw that the giant cats had moved on, perhaps assuming that he too had drowned. He continued his lonely swim downriver. A tributary, he noted, had formed a final barrier, keeping the flames from spreading further. But there were no more towns. After several hours, he began to ponder the wisdom of going ashore. Which shore was the question.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe was spared the decision. Ahead of him was a rocky island with a bonfire. He did not know if he were intruding on a party of Bosmeri or Khajiiti, only that he could swim no more. With straining, aching muscles, he pulled himself onto the rocks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey were Bosmer refugees he gathered, even before they told him. Roasting over the fire was the remains of one of the giant cats that had been stalking him through the jungle on the opposite shore.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Senche-Tiger\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Senche-Tiger\u0022\u003ESenche-Tiger\u003C/a\u003E,\u0022 said one of the young warriors ravenously. \u0022It\u0027s no animal -- it\u0027s as smart as any Cathay-Raht or \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Ohmes\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Ohmes\u0022\u003EOhmes\u003C/a\u003E or any other bleeding Khajiiti.

It was rich, succulent, and sweet, like sugared pork, but no seasonings had been added. He surveyed the crowd as he ate. A sad lot, some still weeping for lost family members. They were the survivors of both the villages of Grenos and Athay, and war was on every person\u0027s lips. Why had the Khajiiti attacked again? Why -- specifically directed at Scotti, as a Cyrodiil -- why was the Emperor not enforcing peace in his provinces?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I was to meet another Cyrodiil,\u0022 he said to a Bosmer maiden who he understood to be from Athay. \u0022His name was Liodes Jurus.

For Decumus Scotti, the jungle was hostile, unfamiliar ground. The enormous vermiculated trees filled the bright morning with darkness, and resembled nothing so much as grasping claws, bent on impeding their progress. Even the fronds of the low plants quivered with malevolent energy. What was worse, he was not alone in his anxiety. His fellow travelers, the natives who had survived the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Khajiit\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Khajiit\u0022\u003EKhajiit\u003C/a\u003E attacks on the villages of Grenos and Athay, wore faces of undisguised fear.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was something sentient in the jungle, and not merely the mad but benevolent indigenous spirits. In his peripheral vision, Scotti could see the shadows of the Khajiiti following the refugees, leaping from tree to tree. When he turned to face them, the lithe forms vanished into the gloom as if they had never been there. But he knew he had seen them. And the Bosmeri saw them too, and quickened their pace.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter eighteen hours, bitten raw by insects, scratched by a thousand thorns, they emerged into a valley clearing. It was night, but a row of blazing torches greeted them, illuminating the leather-wrought tents and jumbled stones of the hamlet of Vindisi. At the end of the valley, the torches marked a sacred site, a gnarled bower of trees pressed closed together to form a temple. Wordlessly, the Bosmeri walked the torch arcade toward the trees. Scotti followed them. When they reached the solid mass of living wood with only one gaping portal, Scotti could see a dim blue light glowing within. A low sonorous moan from a hundred voices echoed within. The Bosmeri maiden he had been following held out her hand, stopping him.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You do not understand, but no outsider, not even a friend may enter,\u0022 she said. \u0022This is a holy place.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EScotti nodded, and watched the refugees march into the temple, heads bowed. Their voices joined with the ones within. When the last wood elf had gone inside, Scotti turned his attention back to the village. There must be food to be had somewhere. A tendril of smoke and a faint whiff of roasting venison beyond the torchlight led him.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey were five Cyrodiils, two \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Breton\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Breton\u0022\u003EBreton\u003C/a\u003Es, and a \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Nord\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Nord\u0022\u003ENord\u003C/a\u003E, the group gathered around a campfire of glowing white stones, pulling steaming strips of meat from the cadaver of a great stag.

He wrote to me, asking that I represent an Imperial building commission and contract some post-war construction.

The Nord and one of the Cyrodiils grabbed a long tarp of wet leather and pulled it across the fire, instantly extinguishing it without so much as a sizzle. Now Scotti could see the intruders, their elliptical yellow eyes and long cruel blades catching the torchlight. He froze with fear, praying that he too was not so visible to them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe felt something bump against his back, and gasped.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EReglius\u0027s voice hissed from up above: \u0022Be quiet for Mara\u0027s sake and climb up here.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EScotti grabbed hold of the knotted double-vine that hung down from a tall tree at the edge of the dead campfire. He scrambled up it as quickly as he could, holding his breath lest any grunt of exertion escape him. At the top of the vine, high above the village, was an abandoned nest from some great bird in a trident-shaped branch. As soon as Scotti had pulled himself into the soft, fragrant straw, Reglius pulled up the vine. No one else was there, and when Scotti looked down, he could see no one below. No one, that is except the Khajiiti, slowly moving toward the glow of the temple tree.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Thank you,\u0022 whispered Scotti, deeply touched that a competitor had helped him. He turned away from the village, and saw that the tree\u0027s upper branches brushed against the mossy rock walls that surrounded the valley below. \u0022How are you at climbing?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027re mad,\u0022 said Reglius under his breath. \u0022We should stay here until they leave.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022If they burn Vindisi like they did Athay and Grenos, we\u0027ll be dead sure as if we were on the ground,\u0022 Scotti began the slow careful climb up the tree, testing each branch. \u0022Can you see what they\u0027re doing?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I can\u0027t really tell,\u0022 Reglius stared down into the gloom. \u0022They\u0027re at the front of the temple. I think they also have ... it looks like long ropes, trailing off behind them, off into the pass.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EScotti crawled onto the strongest branch that pointed toward the wet, rocky face of the cliff. It was not a far jump at all. So close, in fact, that he could smell the moisture and feel the coolness of the stone. But it was a jump nevertheless, and in his history as a clerk, he had never before leapt from a tree a hundred feet off the ground to a sheer rock. He pictured in his mind\u0027s eye the shadows that had pursued him through the jungle from the heights above. How their legs coiled to spring, how their arms snapped forward in an elegant fluid motion to grasp. He leapt.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHis hands grappled for rock, but long thick cords of moss were more accessible. He held hard, but when he tried to plant his feet forward, they slipped up skyward. For a few seconds, he found himself upside down before he managed to pull himself into a more conventional position. There was a narrow outcropping jutting out of the cliff where he could stand and finally exhale.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Reglius. Reglius. Reglius,\u0022 Scotti did not dare to call out. In a minute, there was a shaking of branches, and Lord Vanech\u0027s man emerged. First his satchel, then his head, then the rest of him. Scotti started to whisper something, but Reglius shook his head violently and pointed downward. One of the Khajiiti was at the base of the tree, peering at the remains of the campfire.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EReglius awkwardly tried to balance himself on the branch, but as strong as it was it was exceedingly difficult with only one free hand. Scotti cupped his palms and then pointed at the satchel. It seemed to pain Reglius to let it out of his grasp, but he relented and tossed it to Scotti.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was a small, almost invisible hole in the bag, and when Scotti caught it, a single gold coin dropped out. It rang as it bounced against the rock wall on the descent, a high soft sound that seemed like the loudest alarm Scotti had ever heard.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThen many things happened very quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Cathay-Raht\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Cathay-Raht\u0022\u003ECathay-Raht\u003C/a\u003E at the base of the tree looked up and gave a loud wail. The other Khajiiti followed in chorus, as the cat below crouched down and then sprung up into the lower branches. Reglius saw it below him, climbing up with impossible dexterity, and panicked. Even before he jumped, Scotti could tell that he was going to fall. With a cry, Reglius the Clerk plunged to the ground, breaking his neck on impact.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA flash of white fire erupted from every crevice of the temple, and the moan of the Bosmeri prayer changed into something terrible and otherworldly.

A flood of horrific beasts, tentacled toads, insects of armor and spine, gelatinous serpents, vaporous beings with the face of gods, all poured forth from the great hollow tree, blind with fury. They tore the Khajiiti in front of the temple to pieces. All the other cats fled for the jungle, but as they did so, they began pulling on the ropes they carried. In a few seconds time, the entire village of Vindisi was boiling with the lunatic apparitions of the Wild Hunt.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOver the babbling, barking, howling horde, Scotti heard the Cyrodiils in hiding cry out as they were devoured. The Nord too was found and eaten, and both Bretons. The wizard had turned himself invisible, but the swarm did not rely on their sight. The tree the Cathay-Raht was in began to sway and rock from the impossible violence beneath it. Scotti looked at the Khajiiti\u0027s fear-struck eyes, and held out one of the cords of moss.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe cat\u0027s face showed its pitiful gratitude as it leapt for the vine. It didn\u0027t have time to entirely replace that expression when Scotti pulled back the cord, and watched it fall. The Hunt consumed it to the bone before it struck the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EScotti\u0027s own jump up to the next outcropping of rock was immeasurably more successful. From there, he pulled himself to the top of the cliff and was able to look down into the chaos that had been the village of Vindisi. The Hunt\u0027s mass had grown and began to spill out through the pass out of the valley, pursuing the fleeing Khajiiti. It was then that the madness truly began.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the moons\u0027 light, from Scotti\u0027s vantage, he could see where the Khajiiti had attached their ropes. With a thunderous boom, an avalanche of boulders poured over the pass. When the dust cleared, he saw that the valley had been sealed. The Wild Hunt had nowhere to turn but on itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EScotti turned his head, unable to bear to look at the cannibalistic orgy.

A sudden shiver of gold and red erupted from a hollow nook above, and Scotti was surrounded by six winged creatures scarcely more than a few inches long. Bright crimson eyes were set on either side of tunnel-like protuberances, the animals\u0027 always open mouths. They were legless, and their thin, rapidly beating, aureate wings seemed poorly constructed to transport their fat, swollen bellies. And yet, they darted through the air like sparks from a fire.

He stomped back to the clearing and opened up the satchel again, as he had done some hours before. There was still, unsurprisingly, nothing useful in the bag, and nothing to eat in any corner or pocket. A goodly amount of gold (he smiled grimly, as he had done before, at the irony of being financially solvent in the jungle), a stack of neat blank contracts from Lord Vanech\u0027s building commission, some thin cord, and an oiled leather cloak for bad weather. At least, Scotti considered, he had not suffered rain.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA rolling moan of thunder reminded Scotti of what he had suspected for some weeks now. He was cursed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWithin an hour\u0027s time, he was wearing the cloak and clawing his way through mud. The trees, which had earlier allowed no sunlight in, provided no shelter against the pounding storm and wind. The only sounds that pierced the pelting of the rain were the mocking calls of the flying creatures, flitting just above, babbling their nonsense. Scotti bellowed at them, threw rocks, but they seemed enamored of his company.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile he was reaching to grab a promising looking stone to hurl at his tormentors, Scotti felt something shift beneath his feet. Wet but solid ground suddenly liquefied and became a rolling tide, rushing him forward. Light as a leaf, he flew head over feet over head, until the mudflow dropped and he continued forward, plunging down into a river twenty-five feet below.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe storm passed quite as instantly as it had arrived. The sun melted the dark clouds and warmed Scotti as he swam for the shore. There, another sign of the Khajiiti incursion into Valenwood greeted him. A small fishing village had stood there once, so recently extinct that it smoldered like a still-warm corpse. Dirt cairns that had once housed fish by the smell of them had been ravaged, their bounty turned to ash. Rafts and skiffs lay broken, scuttled, half-submerged. All the villagers were no more, either dead or refugees far away. Or so he presumed. Something banged against the wall of one of the ruins.

Why are you hiding?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs they fell into chattering, Scotti began to search the rest of the village. Surely the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Cat\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Cat\u0022\u003Ecat\u003C/a\u003Es had left something behind, a scrap of dried meat, a morsel of fish sausage, anything. But they had been immaculate in their complete annihilation. There was nothing to eat anywhere. Scotti did find one item of possible use under the tumbled remains of a stone hut. A bow and two arrows made of bone. The string had been lost, likely burned away in the heat of the fire, but he pulled the cord from Reglius\u0027s satchel and restrung it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe creatures flew over and hovered nearby as he worked: \u0022The convent of the sacred Liodes Jurus?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You know about the war! Worms and wine, circumscribe a golden host, apeneck!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe moment the cord was taut, Scotti nocked an arrow and swung around, pulling the string tight against his chest. The winged beasts, having had experience with archers before, shot off in all directions in a blur. They needn\u0027t have bothered. Scotti\u0027s first arrow dove into the ground three feet in front of him. He swore and retrieved it. The mimics, having likewise had experience with poor archers before, returned at once to hovering nearby and mocking Scotti.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn his second shot, Scotti did much better, in purely technical terms. He remembered how the archers in \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Falinesti\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Falinesti\u0022\u003EFalinesti\u003C/a\u003E looked when he pulled himself out from under the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Hoarvor\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Hoarvor\u0022\u003Ehoarvor\u003C/a\u003E tick, and they were all taking aim at him. He extended his left hand, right hand, and right elbow in a symmetrical line, drawing the bow so his hand touched his jawline, and he could see the creature in his sight like the arrow was a finger he was pointing with. The bolt missed the target by only two feet, but it continued on its trajectory, snapping when it struck a rock wall.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EScotti walked to the river\u0027s edge. He had only one arrow left, and perhaps, he considered, it would be most practical to find a slow-moving fish and fire it on that. If he missed, at least there was less of a chance of breaking the shaft, and he could always retrieve it from the water. A rather torpid, whiskered fish rolled by, and he took aim at it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022My name is Decumus Scotti!\u0022 one of the creatures howled, frightening the fish away. \u0022Stupid and a stupid cow! Will you dance a dance in fire!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EScotti turned and aimed the arrow as he had done before. This time, however, he remembered to plant his feet as the archers had done, seven inches apart, knees straight, left leg slightly forward to meet the angle of his right shoulder. He released the last arrow.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe arrow also proved a serviceable prong for roasting the creature against the smoking hot stones of one of the ruins. Its other companions had disappeared instantly after the beast was slain, and Scotti was able to dine in peace. The meat proved to be delicious, if scarcely more than a first course. He was picking the last of it from the bones, when a boat sailed into view from around the bend of the river. At the helm were Bosmer sailors. Scotti ran to the bank and waved his arms. They averted their eyes and continued past.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You bloody, callous bastards!\u0022 Scotti howled. \u0022Knaves! Hooligans! Apenecks! Scoundrels!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA gray-whiskered form came out from a hatch, and Scotti immediately recognized him as Gryf Mallon, the poet translator he had met in the caravan from \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Cyrodiil\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Cyrodiil\u0022\u003ECyrodiil\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe peered Scotti\u0027s direction, and his eyes lit up with delight, \u0022Decumus Scotti! Precisely the man I hoped to see! I want to get your thoughts on a rather puzzling passage in the Mnoriad Pley Bar! It begins \u0027I went weeping into the world, searching for wonders,\u0027 perhaps you\u0027re familiar with it?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027d like nothing better than to discuss the Mnoriad Pley Bar with you, Gryf!\u0022 Scotti called back. \u0022Would you let me come aboard though first?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOverjoyed at being on a ship bound for any port at all, Scotti was true to his word. For over an hour as the boat rolled down the river past the blackened remnants of Bosmeri villages, he asked no questions and spoke nothing of his life over the past weeks: he merely listened to Mallon\u0027s theories of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Merethic_Era\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Merethic Era\u0022\u003Emerethic\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Aldmer\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Aldmer\u0022\u003EAldmeri\u003C/a\u003E esoterica. The translator was undemanding of his guest\u0027s scholarship, accepting nods and shrugs as civilized conversation. He even produced some wine and fish jelly, which he shared with Scotti absent-mindedly, as he expounded on his various theses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, while Mallon was searching for a reference to some minor point in his notes, Scotti asked, \u0022Rather off subject, but I was wondering where we\u0027re bound.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The very heart of the province, Silvenar,\u0022 Mallon said, not looking up from the passage he was reading. \u0022It\u0027s somewhat bothersome, actually, as I wanted to go to \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Woodhearth\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Woodhearth\u0022\u003EWoodhearth\u003C/a\u003E first to talk to a Bosmer there who claims to have an original copy of Dirith Yalmillhiad, if you can believe it.

It\u0027s a tiresome prospect, since the Bosmeri are happy to eat one another, so there\u0027s a risk that at the end, only one fat wood elf will remain to wave the flag.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That is vexing,\u0022 agreed Scotti, sympathetically. \u0022To the east, the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Khajiit\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Khajiit\u0022\u003EKhajiit\u003C/a\u003Ei are burning everything, and to the west, the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Altmer\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Altmer\u0022\u003EHigh Elves\u003C/a\u003E are waging war.

I need to leave fairly shortly myself, as my publisher has set a very definite deadline for my new book of translations.

It\u0027s an odd nomenclature that is typical of this place, the sort of thing that makes my job as a translator that much more challenging. The Silvenar, he, or rather they are the closest the Bosmeri have to a great leader. The essential thing to remember about the Silvenar --\u0022 Mallon smiled, finding the passage he was looking for, \u0022Here! \u0027A fortnight, inexplicable, the world burns into a dance.\u0027 There\u0027s that metaphor again.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What were you saying about the Silvenar?\u0022 asked Scotti. \u0022The essential thing to remember?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I don\u0027t remember what I was saying,\u0022 replied Mallon, turning back to his oration.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a week\u0027s time, the little boat bumped along the shallow, calmer waters of the foaming current the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Xylo_River\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Xylo River\u0022\u003EXylo\u003C/a\u003E had become, and Decumus Scotti first saw the city of Silvenar. If Falinesti was a tree, then Silvenar was a flower. A magnificent pile of faded shades of green, red, blue, and white, shining with crystalline residue. Mallon had mentioned off-hand, when not otherwise explaining \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Aldmer\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Aldmer\u0022\u003EAldmeri\u003C/a\u003E prosody, that Silvenar had once been a blossoming glade in the forest, but owing to some spell or natural cause, the trees\u0027 sap began flowing with translucent liqueur. The process of the sap flowing and hardening over the colorful trees had formed the web of the city.

Gryf Mallon gave him the address of his publisher in the Imperial City, which Scotti accepted and quickly forgot.

All the other sounds and textures of Prithala Hall vanished all around him, as if nothing else existed but the vast form of Jurus. Scotti did not consider himself an emotional man, but he felt a tide flow over him at the sight and sound of the man whose badly written letters had been the guideposts that carried him from the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Imperial_City\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Imperial City\u0022\u003EImperial City\u003C/a\u003E back in early Frost Fall.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Where have you been?\u0022 Jurus demanded again. \u0022I told you to meet me in \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Falinesti\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Falinesti\u0022\u003EFalinesti\u003C/a\u003E weeks ago.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I was there weeks ago,\u0022 Scotti stammered, too surprised to be indignant. \u0022I got your note to meet you in \u003Ca href=\u0022/w/index.php?title=Skyrim:Athay\u0026amp;action=edit\u0026amp;redlink=1\u0022 class=\u0022new\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Athay (page does not exist)\u0022\u003EAthay\u003C/a\u003E, and so I went there, but the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Khajiit\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Khajiit\u0022\u003EKhajiit\u003C/a\u003Ei had burned it to the ground.

The clerk nodded to Basth coldly, still numb and confused. It had not left his mind that only any hour earlier, Scotti had intended to petition the Silvenar for safe passage through the border back to \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Cyrodiil\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Cyrodiil\u0022\u003ECyrodiil\u003C/a\u003E.

When they\u0027re mostly female, so is he. When they cry for food or trade or an absence of foreign interference, he feels it too, and makes laws accordingly. In a way, he\u0027s a despot, but he\u0027s the people\u0027s despot.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That sounds,\u0022 said Scotti, searching for the appropriate word. \u0022Like ... bunk.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Perhaps it is,\u0022 shrugged Basth. \u0022But he has many rights as the Voice of the People, including the granting of foreign building and trade contracts. It\u0027s not important whether you believe us. Just think of the Silvenar as being like one of your mad Emperors, like \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Pelagius_Septim_III\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Pelagius Septim III\u0022\u003EPelagius\u003C/a\u003E. The problem facing us now is that since Valenwood is being attacked on all sides, the Silvenar\u0027s aspect is now one of distrust and fear of foreigners. The one hope of his people, and thus of the Silvenar himself, is that the Emperor will intervene and stop the war.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Will he?\u0022 asked Scotti.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You know as well as we do that the Emperor has not been himself lately,\u0022 Jurus helped himself to Reglius\u0027s satchel and pulled out the blank contracts. \u0022Who knows what he\u0027ll choose to do or not do? That reality is not our concern, but these blessings from the late good sir Reglius make our job much simpler.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey discussed how they would represent themselves to the Silvenar into the evening. Scotti ate continuously, but not nearly so much as Jurus and Basth. When the sun had begun to rise in the hills, its light reddening through the crystal walls of the tavern, Jurus and Basth left to their rooms at the palace, granted to them diplomatically in lieu of an actual immediate audience with the Silvenar. Scotti went to his room. He thought about staying up a little longer to ruminate over Jurus\u0027s plans and see what might be the flaw in them, but upon touching the cool, soft bed, he immediately fell asleep.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe next afternoon, Scotti awoke, feeling himself again. In other words, timid. For several weeks now, he had been a creature bent on mere survival. He had been driven to exhaustion, attacked by several jungle beasts, starved, nearly drowned, and forced into discussions of ancient \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Aldmer\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Aldmer\u0022\u003EAldmeri\u003C/a\u003E poetical works. The discussion he had with Jurus and Basth about how to dupe the Silvenar into signing their contracts seemed perfectly reasonable then. Scotti dressed himself in his old battered clothes and went downstairs in search of food and a peaceful place to think.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027re up,\u0022 cried Basth upon seeing him. \u0022We should go to the palace now.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Now?\u0022 whined Scotti. \u0022Look at me. I need new clothes. This isn\u0027t the way one should dress to pay a call on a prostitute, let alone the Voice of the People of Valenwood. I haven\u0027t even bathed.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You must cease from this moment forward being a clerk, and become a student of mercantile trade,\u0022 said Liodes Jurus grandly, taking Scotti by the arm and leading him into the sunlit boulevard outside. \u0022The first rule is to recognize what you represent to the prospective client, and what angle best suits you. You cannot dazzle him with opulent fashion and professional bearing, my dear boy, and it would be fatal if you attempted to. Trust me on this. Several others besides Basth and I are guests at the palace, and they have made the error of appearing too eager, too formal, too ready for business. They will never be granted audience with the Silvenar, but we have remained aloof ever since the initial rejection. I\u0027ve dallied about the court, spread my knowledge of life in the Imperial City, had my ears pierced, attended promenades, eaten and drunk of all that was given to me. I dare say I\u0027ve put on a pound or two. The message we\u0027ve sent is clear: it is in his, not our, best interest to meet.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Our plan worked,\u0022 added Basth. \u0022When I told his minister that our Imperial representative had arrived, and that we were at last willing to meet with the Silvenar this morning, we were told to bring you there straightaway.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Aren\u0027t we late then?\u0022 asked Scotti.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Very,\u0022 laughed Jurus. \u0022But that\u0027s again part of the angle we\u0027re representing. Benevolent disinterest. Remember not to confuse the Silvenar with conventional nobility. His is the mind of the common people. When you grasp that, you\u0027ll understand how to manipulate him.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJurus spent the last several minutes of the walk through the city expounding on his theories about what Valenwood needed, how much, and at what price. They were staggering figures, far more construction and far higher costs than anything Scotti had been used to dealing with. He listened carefully. All around them, the city of Silvenar revealed itself, glass and flower, roaring winds and beautiful inertia. When they reached the palace of the Silvenar, Decumus Scotti stopped, stunned. Jurus looked at him for a moment and then laughed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s quite bizarre, isn\u0027t it?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat it was. A frozen scarlet burst of twisted, uneven spires as if a rival sun rising. A blossom the size of a village, where courtiers and servants resembled nothing so much as insects walked about it sucking its ichor. Entering over a bent petal-like bridge, the three walked through the palace of unbalanced walls. Where the partitions bent close together and touched, there was a shaded hall or a small chamber. Where they warped away from one another, there was a courtyard. There were no doors anywhere, no any way to get to the Silvenar but by crossing through the entire spiral of the palace, through meetings and bedrooms and dining halls, past dignitaries, consorts, musicians, and many guards.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s an interesting place,\u0022 said Basth. \u0022But not very much privacy. Of course, that suits the Silvenar well.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen they reached the inner corridors, two hours after they first entered the palace, guards, brandishing blades and bows, stopped them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We have an audience with the Silvenar,\u0022 said Jurus, patiently. \u0022This is Lord Decumus Scotti, the Imperial representative.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the guards disappeared down the winding corridor, and returned moments later with a tall, proud Bosmer clad in a loose robe of patchwork leather. He was the Minister of Trade: \u0022The Silvenar wishes to speak with Lord Decumus Scotti alone.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was not the place to argue or show fear, so Scotti stepped forward, not even looking toward Jurus and Basth. He was certain they were showing their masks of benevolent indifference. Following the Minister into the audience chamber, Scotti recited to himself all the facts and figures Jurus had presented to him. He willed himself to remember the Angle and the Image he must project.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe audience chamber of the Silvenar was an enormous dome where the walls bent from bowl-shaped at the base inward to almost meet at the top. A thin ray of sunlight streamed through the fissure hundreds of feet above, and directly upon the Silvenar, who stood upon a puff of shimmering gray powder. For all the wonder of the city and the palace, the Silvenar himself looked perfectly ordinary. An average, blandly handsome, slightly tired-looking, extra-ordinary Wood Elf of the type one might see in any capitol in the Empire. It was only when he stepped from the dais that Scotti noticed an eccentricity in his appearance. He was very short.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I had to speak with you alone,\u0022 said the Silvenar in a voice common and unrefined. \u0022May I see your papers?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EScotti handed him the blank contracts from Lord Vanech\u0027s Building Commission. The Silvenar studied them, running his finger over the embossed seal of the Emperor, before handing them back. He suddenly seemed shy, looking to the floor. \u0022There are many charlatans at my court who wish to benefit from the wars. I thought you and your colleagues were among them, but those contracts are genuine.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, they are,\u0022 said Scotti calmly. The Silvenar\u0027s conventional aspect made it easy for Scotti to speak, with no formal greetings, no deference, exactly as Jurus had instructed: \u0022It seems most sensible to begin straightaway talking about the roads which need to be rebuilt, and then the harbors that the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Altmer\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Altmer\u0022\u003EAltmer\u003C/a\u003Ei have destroyed, and then I can give you my estimates on the cost of resupplying and renovating the trade routes.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Why hasn\u0027t the Emperor seen fit to send a representative when the war with \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Elsweyr\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Elsweyr\u0022\u003EElsweyr\u003C/a\u003E began, two years ago?\u0022 asked the Silvenar glumly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EScotti thought a moment before replying of all the common Bosmeri he had met in Valenwood. The greedy, frightened mercenaries who had escorted him from the border. The hard-drinking revelers and expert pest exterminating archers in the Western Cross of Falinesti. Nosy old Mother Pascost in Havel Slump. Captain Balfix, the poor sadly reformed pirate. The terrified but hopeful refugees of Athay and Grenos. The mad, murderous, self-devouring \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Wild_Hunt\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Wild Hunt\u0022\u003EWild Hunt\u003C/a\u003E of Vindisi. The silent, dour boatmen hired by Gryf Mallon. The degenerate, grasping Basth. If one creature represented their total disposition, and that of many more throughout the province, what would be his personality? Scotti was a clerk by occupation and nature, instinctively comfortable cataloging and filing, making things fit in a system. If the soul of Valenwood were to be filed, where would it be put?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe answer came upon him almost before he posed himself the question. Denial.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m afraid that question doesn\u0027t interest me,\u0022 said Scotti. \u0022Now, can we get back to the business at hand?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAll afternoon, Scotti and the Silvenar discussed the pressing needs of Valenwood. Every contract was filled and signed. So much was required and there were so many costs associated that addendums and codicils had to be scribbled into the margins of the papers, and those had to be resigned. Scotti maintained his benevolent indifference, but he found that dealing with the Silvenar was not quite the same as dealing with a simple, sullen child. The Voice of the People knew certain practical, everyday things very well: the yields of fish, the benefits of trade, the condition of every township and forest in his province.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We will have a banquet tomorrow night to celebrate this commission,\u0022 said the Silvenar at last.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Best make it tonight,\u0022 replied Scotti. \u0022We should leave for Cyrodiil with the contracts tomorrow, so I\u0027ll need a safe passage to the border. We best not waste any more time.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Agreed,\u0022 said the Silvenar, and called for his Minister of Trade to put his seal on the contracts and arrange for the feast.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EScotti left the chamber, and was greeted by Basth and Jurus. Their faces showed the strain of maintaining the illusion of unconcern for too many hours. As soon as they were out of sight of the guards, they begged Scotti to tell them all. When he showed them the contract, Basth began weeping with delight.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Anything about the Silvenar that surprised you?\u0022 asked Jurus.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I hadn\u0027t expected him to be half my height.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Was he?\u0022 Jurus looked mildly surprised. \u0022He must have shrunk since I tried to have an audience with him earlier.

They looked on Decumus Scotti, Liodes Jurus, and Basth with undisguised hatred. It made Scotti very uncomfortable, but Jurus delighted in it. As the servants brought in platter after platter of roasted meats, Jurus poured himself a cup of Jagga and toasted the clerk.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I can confess it now,\u0022 said Jurus. \u0022I had grave doubts about inviting you to join me on this adventure.

At first it seemed very disagreeable to his palate, but a moment later he found he had drained the mug and was pouring another. His body tingled. All the sounds in the chamber seemed oddly disjointed, but not frighteningly so.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So you\u0027re the fellow who got the Silvenar to sign all those contracts,\u0022 said the second diplomat. \u0022That must have required some deep negotiation.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Not at all, not at all, just a little basic \u003Cspan title=\u0022Please do NOT CHANGE to \u0026quot;understanding\u0026quot;: the original source is intentionally copied and has the error.\u0022 style=\u0022border-bottom:1px dotted\u0022\u003Eunderstand\u0026#160;\u003Ci\u003E\u003Csmall\u003E[\u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/UESPWiki:Spelling#Quotes\u0022 title=\u0022UESPWiki:Spelling\u0022\u003Esic\u003C/a\u003E]\u003C/small\u003E\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E of mercantile trading,\u0022 grinned Scotti, pouring himself a third mug of Rotmeth. \u0022The Silvenar was very eager to involve the Imperial state with the affairs of Valenwood.

The diplomats bade him their respects and went to talk to the Minister. Scotti stumbled out of the palace, and reeled through the strange, organic avenues and boulevards of the city.

Once there, he slept, very nearly on his bed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe next morning, he woke to Jurus and Basth in his room, shaking him.

They surrounded a carriage crested with the official arms of Valenwood. Still dazed, Scotti climbed in, and the captain of the guard gave the signal. They began a quick gallop. Scotti shook himself, and then peered behind. Basth and Jurus were waving him goodbye.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Wait!\u0022 Scotti cried. \u0022Aren\u0027t you coming back to the Imperial Province too?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The Silvenar asked that we stay behind as Imperial representatives!\u0022 yelled Liodes Jurus. \u0022In case there\u0027s a need for more contracts and negotiations!

Soon it disappeared altogether as the convoy rounded the streets of Silvenar. The jungle loomed suddenly and then they were in it. Scotti had only gone through it by foot or along the rivers by slow-moving boats. Now it flashed all around him in profusions of greens. The horses seemed even faster moving through underbrush than on the smooth paths of the city. None of the weird sounds or dank smells of the jungle penetrated the escort. It felt to Scotti as if he were watching a play about the jungle with a background of a quickly moving scrim, which offered only the merest suggestion of the place.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo it went for two weeks. There was lots of food and water in the carriage with the clerk, so he merely ate and slept as the caravan pressed endlessly on. From time to time, he\u0027d hear the sound of blades clashing, but when he looked around whatever had attacked the caravan had long since been left behind. At last, they reached the border, where an Imperial garrison was stationed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EScotti presented the soldiers who met the carriage with the papers. They asked him a barrage of questions that he answered monosyllabically, and then let him pass. It took several more days to arrive at the gates of the Imperial City. The horses that had flown so fast through the jungle now slowed down in the unfamiliar territory of the wooded \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Colovia\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Colovia\u0022\u003EColovian\u003C/a\u003E Estates. By contrast, the cries of his province\u0027s birds and smells of his province\u0027s plant life brought Decumus Scotti alive. It was if he had been dreaming all the past months.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the gates of the City, Scotti\u0027s carriage door was opened for him and he stepped out on uncertain legs. Before he had a moment to say something to the escort, they had vanished, galloping back south through the forest. The first thing he did now that he was home was go to the closest tavern and have tea and fruit and bread. If he never ate meat again, he told himself, that would suit him very nicely.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENegotiations with Lord Atrius and Lord Vanech proceeded immediately thereafter. It was most agreeable. Both commissions recognized how lucrative the rebuilding of Valenwood would be for their agency. Lord Vanech claimed, quite justifiably, that as the contracts had been written on forms notarized by his commission, he had the legal right to them.

After the second successful invasion, secret underground tunnels were found and filled in, but once again, come morning, the soldiers were again dead, and the citizens had returned. After the third successful siege, legions were posted outside of the town, watching the roads and riverway for signs of attacks, but no one came.

Just as they were ready to give up, the great centurion noticed two curious things.

They would decide as a group which fields were best for wheat, orchard, vine, livestock, or apiary, and thereby always have the best yields of any farm which worked alone, doing the best as it could with what it had.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAsliel had a particularly poor farm for most kind of agriculture, but small herbs found its stony, loamless, acidic soil very comfortable.

Despite his ministrations, she grew weaker and weaker every morning. Finally, he gave her a bitter tasting drink, and the next morning, ashes were found all around her bed. A \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Vampire\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Vampire\u0022\u003Evampire\u003C/a\u003E had been feeding on the poor girl, but Asliel\u0027s potion had turned her very blood into poison, without harming her in the least.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf only this formula had not been lost in the mists of history!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis would have been enough to make him a minor but significant figure in the annals of early Summurset, but at that point in history, a barbarian tribe called the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Locvar\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Locvar\u0022\u003ELocvar\u003C/a\u003E had found their way down the Diren River, and recognized Tyrigel as a rich target for raids. The Direnni, not being warriors yet but simple farmers, were helpless and could only flee and watch the Locvar take the best of their crops, raid after raid.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAsliel, however, had been experimenting with the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Vampire_Dust\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Vampire Dust\u0022\u003Evampire dust\u003C/a\u003E, and brought his cousins to him with a plan. The next time the Locvar were sighted on the Diren, the word went out and all the most able-bodied came to Asliel\u0027s laboratory. When the barbarians arrived in Tyrigel, they found the farms deserted, and assumed that all had fled as usual. As they set about stealing the bounty, they suddenly found themselves under attack by invisible forces. Believing the Direnni farms to be haunted, they ran away very quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey attempted a few more raids, for their greed would always eventually overpower their fear, and each time, they were set upon by attackers who they could not see. As barbaric as they were, they were not stupid, and they changed their mind about the source of their defeat. It could not be that the farms were haunted, because the crops were still being tended and harvested, and the animals seemed to show no fear. The Locvar decided to send a scout to the farm to see if he could spy their secrets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe scout sent word back to the Locvar that the Direnni farms were populated with flesh and blood, entirely visible Altmer. He continued to watch as his barbarian cohorts moved down the river, and he saw the elderly and children flee for the hills, while the able-bodied farmers and their wives went to Asliel\u0027s laboratory. He saw them go in; he saw no one come out.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs usual, the Locvar were repelled by invisible forces, but their scout soon told them what he saw happening in the laboratory.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe next night, two of the Locvar approached Asliel\u0027s farm very stealthily, and managed to kidnap him without alerting the rest of the Direnni. The Locvar chieftain, knowing that the farmers could no longer count on the alchemist to make them invisible, considered an immediate attack on the farms. But he was a vengeful sort, and felt he had been humiliated by these simple farmers. A crafty plan emerged in his mind. What if the Direnni, who always saw his barbarian tribe coming, for once did not? Imagine the slaughter if no one even had a chance to flee.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe scout had told the chieftain that Asliel had used the dust of a vampire to make the farmers invisible, but he was not sure what the other ingredient had been. He described an incandescent powder that Asliel had mixed into the dust. Asliel, of course, refused to help the Locvar, but they were experts in torture as well as pillage, and he knew he would have to talk or die.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally after hours of torture, he agreed to tell them what the incandescent powder was. He did not know the name, but he called it \u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Glow_Dust\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Glow Dust\u0022\u003EGlow Dust\u003C/a\u003E,\u0022 the only remains of a slain will-o\u0027-the-wisp. He told them they would need a lot of it if they wanted to turn the whole tribe invisible for the raid.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Locvar grumbled that not only did they have to find and kill a vampire to attain his dust, but find and kill several will-o\u0027-the-wisps to get theirs. In a few days time, they came back with the ingredients the alchemist asked for. The chieftain, not being a complete idiot, made Asliel taste the potion first. He did as he was told and turned invisible, demonstrating that it did truly work. The chieftain put him to work creating more. No one apparently noticed that while he did, he was nibbling on black lichen and roobrush.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Locvar took the potion as he doled it out, and soon, but not too soon that they didn\u0027t suffer, they were all dead.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe scout who had seen Asliel mixing the invisibility potion had apparently mistook the glow of the candlelight in the laboratory for an incandescence which the second ingredient of the invisibility potion did not possess. The second ingredient was actually dull, simple \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Redwort_Flower\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Redwort Flower\u0022\u003Eredwort\u003C/a\u003E, one of the most common herbs in Tamriel. When they had insisted during torture that Asliel tell them what the incandescent powder was, Asliel remembered that he had once experimentally mixed glow dust and vampire dust together once and created a powerful poison. It was simple enough to steal a little redwort from the barbarian\u0027s camp, mix that with the vampire and glow dust mixture, and create a potion that was in fact an invisibility poison. After curing himself, he gave the poison to the barbarians.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Locvar, being dead, never again raided the Direnni farms, and having no other enemies, they were able to grow more and more prosperous and powerful. Generations later, they left Summurset and began their historic adventures on the Tamriel mainland. Asliel Direnni, because of his excellence as an alchemist, was invited to \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Artaeum\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Artaeum\u0022\u003EArtaeum\u003C/a\u003E and became a \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Psijic_Order\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Psijic Order\u0022\u003EPsijic\u003C/a\u003E. It is not known how many more of the common formulas we know today were invented by him there, but I have no doubt, the science and art of alchemy as we know it today would not exist without him.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut that is all in the distant past. Asliel\u0027s innovations, like my modest ones, like the achievements of the Dirennis throughout history, are but a stepping stone to the wonders which will come in the future. I wish I could be there to witness them, but if I can only share some of the past with the children of Direnni and the children of Tamriel, then I will consider my life well spent.\u003C/p\u003E\n","Author":"Vorian Direnni","Description":"Tales about a creator of Alchemy Science","Type":"Alchemy skill book","CoverImage":"SR-icon-book-BasicBook7.png"},{"Id":"0001AFDD","Title":"Death Blow of Abernanit","Text":null,"Author":"Anonymous (with notes by Geocrates Varnus)","Description":"The death of Dagoth Thras","Type":"Block skill book","CoverImage":"SR-icon-book-BasicBook2.png"},{"Id":"000ED040","Title":"Death of a Wanderer","Text":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022T\u0022 src=\u0022//images.uesp.net/thumb/1/18/T_letter.png/44px-T_letter.png\u0022 title=\u0022T\u0022 width=\u002244\u0022 height=\u002245\u0022 style=\u0022vertical-align: baseline\u0022 srcset=\u0022//images.uesp.net/thumb/1/18/T_letter.png/66px-T_letter.png 1.5x, //images.uesp.net/thumb/1/18/T_letter.png/88px-T_letter.png 2x\u0022\u003Ehe last time I saw the old \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Argonian\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Argonian\u0022\u003EArgonian\u003C/a\u003E, I was taken by how alive he seemed, even though he was in the throes of death.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The secret,\u0022 he said, \u0022of staying alive... is not in running away, but swimming directly at danger.

Unlike the more controversial areas of dwarven scholarship, the construction of dwarven cities and relics are well-founded due to the plethora of samples taken from the ruins these peoples have left behind. My own home city, \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Markarth\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Markarth\u0022\u003EMarkarth\u003C/a\u003E, was originally one such ruin, and I can state from first-hand experience that all dwarven designs share a set of common principles that we can use to determine true artifacts from fakes and delineate patterns and methodologies that were important to their craftsmen.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, we can say for certain that dwarven artisans favored stone, at least as far as their buildings were concerned. This is no surprise. With notable exceptions, the vast majority of dwarven architecture is found underground or carved out of mountains. It is possible, although only theoretically, that the dwarves first mastered masonry as a race quite early, and later examples of metalwork were added on to much earlier stone designs as the dwarves began to master more complex tools. Regardless, the foundation of all known dwarven ruins is built on stonework, and the structure of dwarven stonework is sharp, angular, and intensely mathematical in nature.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBy a simple count, there are hundreds if not thousands of samples of dwarven buildings made of precise square shapes, and far fewer examples of discretely rounded or curved stonework, leading us to believe that early dwarves favored trusted, well-calculated designs based on angled lines rather than riskier, more imprecise calculations based on arcs and curves.

We cannot, however, discount more easily destructible materials such as clay, paper, and glass from outside the scope of dwarven craftsmanship, but given the tendency of dwarven design to favor the long-lasting over the fragile, we can safely assume that at the very least metal was a heavy preference. And the metal used in all so-far-discovered dwarven relics is entirely unique to their culture.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENo other race has replicated whatever process was used to create dwarven metal. Although it can be easily mistaken for bronze -- and in fact many forgers of dwarven materials use bronze to create their fake replicas -- it is most definitely a distinct type of metal of its own.

Unlike many other cultures still existing today, the dwarves built and relied on increasingly complicated machines for a wide variety of martial tasks, and weapons and armor created solely for the purpose of being wielded by dwarven warriors show remarkably fewer points of progress beyond the basic designs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELet us begin by analyzing those basic weapons and armors. Anyone who has held a dwarven axe or worn a dwarven helmet can testify as to the ancient, ever-lasting quality of dwarven craftsmanship. Weapons do not deviate too greatly from their base function. Dwarven swords pierce through light armors with incredible effectiveness, owing primarily to the remarkable sharpness of tempered dwarven metal, and owing to a far lesser extent to its simple, double-edged design.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECompare and contrast a sharp, angular dwarven dagger to a curved elven blade, and it becomes a small logical leap to say that dwarven weaponsmiths relied almost exclusively on creating quality materials first, and merely allowed the form of those materials to flow from the method that weapon was intended to kill people.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a culture that built almost exclusively underground, it\u0027s no surprise that dwarven armors are built to withstand incredibly heavy blows. Again, the fact that they are also resistant to being pierced by arrows or small blades is more of a testament to superior dwarven metallurgy over superior dwarven armorsmithing, but it would be erroneous to thus conclude that dwarven smiths did not take the manufacture of their weapons and armor very seriously. Every piece of war crafts I have examined show a remarkable amount of unnecessary detailing and personalization that is just as evident today among the most ardent blacksmiths.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA dwarven smith probably came from a long tradition that distinguished itself in way that, say, the grip of a mace would feel, or the design of the head of individual arrows. Although, due to the paltry lack of any cultural artifacts outside the weapons and armors themselves, this is only mere speculation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe last, but probably most important discussion in this volume, pertains to the existence of dwarven machinery. Dwarves created and manufactured on a very broad scale thousands of mechanical apparatuses of varying complexity. The most simple of which is the standard \u0022arachnid\u0022 design used to ward off trespassers. We are so far uncertain as to how the dwarves were able to bring to life these remarkably intelligent machines, but I have witnessed one stalk a highly trained thief for several hours, only to ambush him as he was dealing with a lock to some room or treasure trove -- I admit to have forgotten the details past the point at which it began spouting lightning at him.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDwarven military machines also range from the human-sized \u0022Sphere\u0022 warrior, which patrols the interiors of the ruins as a harmless ball only to emerge from it as a fully armed and armored automaton fighter, to the justly feared \u0022Centurion\u0022 whose height ranges from twice to several hundred times human size depending on which reports you believe.\u003C/p\u003E\n","Author":"Calcelmo, Scholar of Markarth","Description":"A scholarly work on the war equipment and machinery of Dwemer","Type":"","CoverImage":"SR-icon-book-BasicBook6.png"},{"Id":"0008316A","Title":"Dwarves, v3","Text":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022I\u0022 src=\u0022//images.uesp.net/thumb/4/48/I_letter.png/30px-I_letter.png\u0022 title=\u0022I\u0022 width=\u002230\u0022 height=\u002245\u0022 style=\u0022vertical-align: baseline\u0022 srcset=\u0022//images.uesp.net/thumb/4/48/I_letter.png/45px-I_letter.png 1.5x, //images.uesp.net/thumb/4/48/I_letter.png/60px-I_letter.png 2x\u0022\u003En this final volume on our discussion on the dwarves (again, see the term \u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Dwemer\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Dwemer\u0022\u003EDwemer\u003C/a\u003E\u0022 for references using the more scholastic name), we will attempt an examination into the distinct culture and history of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Tamriel\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Tamriel\u0022\u003ETamriel\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s Lost Race. We must, however, begin such a discussion with a warning. Despite what certain academic circles would like people to believe, there is so far no evidence that verifies any claim as to the dwarves\u0027 particular customs, morals, myths, legends, laws, systems of governance, or involvement in major historical events outside of those few examples that remain indisputable.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, while we can say with absolute certainty that the disappearance of the entire dwarven race happened very suddenly, only the laziest of junior scholars would say that this event happened in the same day or even the same hour. There is simply no proof to dispute the theory that perhaps the dwarves disappeared from Tamriel gradually over the course of several years or indeed several decades.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is also nothing that disproves the source of this disappearance as being attributable to mass deaths, plagues, magical contamination, experiments into the nature of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Aetherius\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Aetherius\u0022\u003EAetherius\u003C/a\u003E gone wrong, or even race-wide teleportation into one of the planes of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Oblivion\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Oblivion\u0022\u003EOblivion\u003C/a\u003E.

And past the First Era, no race makes note of encountering any living dwarves at all. This is further confounded by the fact that so many of the dark elven writings on their relationship with the dwarves were lost during the tragic eruptions of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Vvardenfell\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Vvardenfell\u0022\u003EVvardenfell\u003C/a\u003E during the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Oblivion_Crisis\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Oblivion Crisis\u0022\u003EOblivion Crisis\u003C/a\u003E nearly 200 years ago.

Little is known of the author, but Marobar Sul was most likely a pseudonym of Gor Felim, a prolific writer of \u0022penny dreadful romances\u0022 of that era, who is known to have used many other pseudonyms. While most of Felim\u0027s other work has, thankfully, been lost to history, what little survives matches Ancient Tales in both language and tone (see Lomis, \u0022Textual Comparison of Gor Felim\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:A_Hypothetical_Treachery\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:A Hypothetical Treachery\u0022\u003EA Hypothetical Treachery\u003C/a\u003E with Marobar Sul\u0027s Ancient Tales of the Dwemer\u0022).

Why he decided to turn his hand to the Dwemer is unknown, but it is clear that his \u0022research\u0022 consisted of nothing more than collecting the peasants\u0027 tales of the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Nibenay_Valley\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Nibenay Valley\u0022\u003ENibenay Valley\u003C/a\u003E and recasting them in Dwemer guise.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe book proved popular in Cyrodiil, and Felim continued to churn out more volumes until the series numbered seven in all. Ancient Tales of the Dwemer was thus firmly established as a local favorite in Cyrodiil (already in its 17th printing) when the historical forces that propelled Tiber Septim to prominence also began to spread the literature of the \u0022heartland\u0022 across the continent. Marobar Sul\u0027s version of the Dwemer was seized upon in a surge of human racial nationalism that has not yet subsided.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Dwemer appear in these tales as creatures of fable and light fantasy, but in general they are \u0022just like us\u0022. They come across as a bit eccentric, perhaps, but certainly there is nothing fearsome or dangerous about them. Compare these to the Dwemer of early \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Redguard\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Redguard\u0022\u003ERedguard\u003C/a\u003E legend: a mysterious, powerful race, capable of bending the very laws of nature to their will; vanished but perhaps not gone. Or the Dwemer portrayed in the most ancient \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Nord\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Nord\u0022\u003ENord\u003C/a\u003E sagas: fearsome warriors, tainted by blasphemous religious practices, who used their profane mechanisms to drive the Nords from \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Morrowind\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Morrowind\u0022\u003EMorrowind\u003C/a\u003E. Marobar Sul\u0027s Dwemer were much more amenable to the spirit of the time, which saw humans as the pinnacle of creation and the other races as unenlightened barbarians or imperfect, lesser versions of humans eager for tutelage. Ancient Tales falls firmly in the latter camp, which does much to explain its enduring hold on the popular imagination. Marobar Sul\u0027s Dwemer are so much more comfortable, so much friendlier, so much more familiar, than the real Dwemer, whose truly mysterious nature we are only beginning to understand. The public prefers the light, trivial version of this vanished race. And from what I have learned in my years of studying the Dwemer, I have some sympathy for that preference.

Recorded history supports this, specifically mentioning the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Rourken\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Rourken\u0022\u003ERourken\u003C/a\u003E Clan\u0027s refusal to join King \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Dumac\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Dumac\u0022\u003EDumac\u003C/a\u003E in the forming of the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:First_Council\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:First Council\u0022\u003EFirst Council\u003C/a\u003E, and their subsequent exodus to \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Hammerfell\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Hammerfell\u0022\u003EHammerfell\u003C/a\u003E. The architectural premise is also sound, as the building habits of the Dwarves adapted and changed, albeit slowly and in subtle ways, over time and land. I propose that some of these differences are stylistic as well as practical.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETraditional viewpoints suggest that the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Vvardenfell\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Vvardenfell\u0022\u003EVvardenfell\u003C/a\u003E Dwemer were the most prolific of their kind. Based on my excavations throughout \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Skyrim\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Skyrim\u0022\u003ESkyrim\u003C/a\u003E, Morrowind and \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:High_Rock\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:High Rock\u0022\u003EHigh Rock\u003C/a\u003E, I am not sure that this is the case. While Vvardenfell is almost cluttered with dwarven ruins poking through the surface of the landscape, the construction of those ruins is fundamentally different from the majority of what I\u0027ve observed elsewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFurther, as we delve into Vvardenfell ruins, we notice that their internal structure is quite different. While major civic and operational chambers are found near the surface in a Vvardenfell Ruin, that is not typically the case on the Mainland. Minor passageways and storehouse rooms are near the surface, but more important locations don\u0027t occur until we explore much deeper.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause such major locations are well-hidden in Dwemer Ruins outside of Morrowind, many scholars believed they were in fact not present in ruins outside that province. This premature conclusion led some to believe such sites to be mere outposts. My research has shown this not to be the case.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few theories that may explain this difference. Perhaps Clan architects simply had their own styles and preferences when it came to civic planning. This seems only somewhat likely, as Dwarven techniques were based on empirical study, there was likely little room for creative interpretation when it came to building technique. Geological makeup of the terrain almost certainly played a role, especially in a region like Northern Skyrim where the ground near the surface is very rocky and often frozen, versus the volcanic substratum common in Vvardenfell or the ubiquitous aquifers found in Hammerfell. It\u0027s possible that Dwarven architects in the North were not even able to excavate larger structures until reaching more pliable stratum.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis scholar would like to suggest, however, that many structures west of Morrowind were built after 1E420. When the Clan Rourken left Vvardenfell, it seems evident that several clans broke off to create their own settlements, and chose to live in greater isolation than their Eastern brethren. This theory is particularly fascinating, because it leads me to believe that Dwarven architects may have developed even more elaborate methods of hiding their strongholds over time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis opens the distinct possibility that undisturbed dwarven archaeological sites exist throughout \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Tamriel\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Tamriel\u0022\u003ETamriel\u003C/a\u003E, even in southern areas like \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Cyrodiil\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Cyrodiil\u0022\u003ECyrodiil\u003C/a\u003E or \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Black_Marsh\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Black Marsh\u0022\u003EBlack Marsh\u003C/a\u003E where Dwarves are not believed to have ever had a significant presence.

Deep Venues are often characterized as being made up of one or more expansive natural caverns in which several other structures will occur.

Very few have been properly studied before disruption by grave-robbers or greedy adventurers, but those few undisturbed sites have contained a surprising collection of magical objects such as soul-gems, alchemical concoctions and magical texts. Some scholars take these as evidence that the Dwemer did, in fact, dabble in the magical arts. Based on what we know of their culture, as well as the fact that most arcanex are minor structures compared to other common fixtures, I would suggest that these were centers of study and nothing more. Perhaps the Dwarves established these Halls as a means to study men and mer, who surely seemed as alien to them as the Dwemer seem to us today?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat Animoculotories can be found in many Dwarven strongholds.

That was the aspect of it Galerion most objected to. He wanted the study of magic to be free. Well, not free exactly, but at least available to all who could afford it. In doing that, he changed the course of life in \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Tamriel\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Tamriel\u0022\u003ETamriel\u003C/a\u003E.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022He codified the praxes and rituals used by all modern potionmakers, itemmakers, and spellmakers, didn\u0027t he, Great Sage?\u0022 asked Vonguldak.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That was only part of it. Magic as we know it today comes from Vanus Galerion. He restructured the schools to be understandable by the masses.

Well, eventually he created that.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What do you mean, Great Sage?\u0022 asked Taksim.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The first tools were more automated than the ones we have today.

The tools he invented were like robotic master enchanters and alchemists, capable of creating anything the customer required, provided he could pay.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So someone could, for example, create a sword that would cleave the world in twain?\u0022 asked Vonguldak.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I suppose, in theory, but it would probably take all the gold in the world,\u0022 chuckled the Great Sage. \u0022No, I can\u0027t say we were ever in very great danger, but that it isn\u0027t to say that there weren\u0027t a few unfortunate incidents where a unschooled yokel invented something beyond his ken. Eventually, of course, Galerion tore apart his old tools, and created what we use today.

For the first year of his adoption of the hermit life, his few remaining friends and family -- friends and family of his dead wife, truth be told -- had tried visiting, but even the most indefatigable kin gives up eventually when given no encouragement. No one had a good reason to keep in touch with Thaurbad Hulzik, and in time, very few even tried. His sister-in-law sent him the occasional letter with news of people he could barely remember, but even that communication was rare. Most of messages to and from his house dealt with his business, writing the weekly proclamation from the Temple of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Auri-El\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Auri-El\u0022\u003EAuri-El\u003C/a\u003E. These were bulletins nailed on the temple door, community news, sermons, that sort of thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first message Gorgos brought him that day was from his healer, reminding him of his appointment on Turdas. Thaurbad took a while to write his response, glum and affirmative. He had the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Crimson_Plague\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Crimson Plague\u0022\u003ECrimson Plague\u003C/a\u003E, which he was being treated for at considerable expense -- you have to remember these were the days before the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Restoration\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Restoration\u0022\u003ESchool of Restoration\u003C/a\u003E had become quite so specialized. It was a dreadful disease and had taken away his voicebox. That was why he only communicated by script.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe next message was from Alfiers, the secretary at the church, as curt and noxious as ever: \u0022THAURBAD, ATTACHED IS SUNDAS\u0027S SERMON, NEXT WEEK\u0027S EVENTS CALENDAR, AND THE OBITUARIES.

Of course, it was possible his clairvoyance was accurate and she had just lost weight.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhatever Alfiers looked like, her attitude towards Thaurbad was clear, unwavering disdain. She hated his sense of humor, always found the most minor of misspellings, and considered his structure and calligraphy the worst kind of amateur work. Luckily, working for a temple was the next most secure job to working for the good King of Alinor. It didn\u0027t bring in very much money, but his expenses were minimal. The truth was, he didn\u0027t need to do it anymore. He had quite a fortune stashed away, but he didn\u0027t have anything else to occupy his days. And the truth was further that having little else to occupy his time and thoughts, the Bulletin was very important to him.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGorgos, having delivered all the messages, began to clean and as he did so, he told Thaurbad all the news in town. The boy always did so, and Thaurbad seldom paid him any attention, but this time he had an interesting report. The Mages Guild had come to Alinor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs Thaurbad listened intently, Gorgos told him all about the Guild, the remarkable Archmagister, and the incredible tools of alchemy and enchanting. Finally, when the lad had finished, Thaurbad scribbled a quick note and handed it and a quill to Gorgos. The note read, \u0022Have them enchant this quill.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It will be expensive,\u0022 said Gorgos.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThaurbad gave Gorgos a sizeable chunk of the thousands of gold pieces he had saved over the years, and sent him out the door. Now, Thaurbad decided, he would finally have the ability to impress Alfiers and bring glory to the Temple of Auri-El.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe way I\u0027ve heard the story, Gorgos had thought about taking the gold and leaving Alinor, but he had come to care for poor old Thaurbad. And even more, he hated Alfiers who he had to see every day to get his messages for his master. It wasn\u0027t perhaps for the best of motivations, but Gorgos decided to go to the Guild and get the quill enchanted.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Mages Guild was not then, especially not then, an elitist institution, as I have said, but when the messenger boy came in and asked to use the Itemmaker, he was greeted with some suspicion. When he showed the bag of gold, the attitude melted, and he was ushered in the room.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow, I haven\u0027t seen one of the enchanting tools of old, so you must use your imagination. There was a large prism for the item to be bound with magicka, assuredly, and an assortment of soul gems and globes of trapped energies. Other than that, I cannot be certain how it looked or how it worked. Because of all the gold he gave to the Guild, Gorgos could infuse the quill with the highest-price soul available, which was something \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Daedra\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Daedra\u0022\u003Edaedric\u003C/a\u003E called Feyfolken. The initiate at the Guild, being ignorant as most Guildmembers were at that time, did not know very much about the spirit except that it was filled with energy. When Gorgos left the room, the quill had been enchanted to its very limit and then some. It was virtually quivering with power.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course, when Thaurbad used it, that\u0027s when it became clear how over his head he was.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd now,\u0022 said the Great Sage. \u0022It\u0027s time for your test.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But what happened?

However, the story does touch on some issues of the natures of spirits and thus is related to conjuration, so I\u0027ll continue.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThaurbad began using the quill to write the Temple Bulletin, and there was something about the slightly lopsided, almost three-dimensional quality of the letters that Thaurbad liked a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EInto the night, Thaurbad put together the Temple of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Auri-El\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Auri-El\u0022\u003EAuri-El\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s Bulletin. For the moment he washed over the page with the Feyfolken quill, it became a work of art, an illuminated manuscript crafted of gold, but with good, simple and strong vernacular. The sermon excerpts read like poetry, despite being based on the archpriest\u0027s workmanlike exhortation of the most banal of the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Alessian_Doctrines\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Alessian Doctrines\u0022\u003EAlessian doctrines\u003C/a\u003E. The obituaries of two of the Temple\u0027s chief benefactors were stark and powerful, pitifully mundane deaths transitioned into world-class tragedies. Thaurbad worked the magical palette until he nearly fainted from exhaustion. At six o\u0027clock in the morning, a day before deadline, he handed the Bulletin to Gorgos for him to carry to Alfiers, the Temple secretary.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs expected, Alfiers never wrote back to compliment him or even comment on how early he had sent the bulletin. It didn\u0027t matter. Thaurbad knew it was the best Bulletin the Temple had ever posted. At one o\u0027clock on Sundas, Gorgos brought him many messages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The Bulletin today was so beautiful, when I read it in the vestibule, I\u0027m ashamed to tell you I wept copiously,\u0022 wrote the archpriest. \u0022I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve seen anything that captures Auri-El\u0027s glory so beautifully before. The cathedrals of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Firsthold\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Firsthold\u0022\u003EFirsthold\u003C/a\u003E pale in comparison. My friend, I prostrate myself before the greatest artist since Gallael.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe archpriest was, like most men of the cloth, given to hyperbole. Still, Thaurbad was happy with the compliment. More messages followed. All of the Temple Elders and thirty-three of the parishioners young and old had all taken the time to find out who wrote the bulletin and how to get a message to congratulate him. And there was only one person they could go through for that information: Alfiers. Imaging the dragon lady besieged by his admirers filled Thaurbad with positive glee.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe was still in a good mood the next day when he took the ferry to his appointment with his healer, Telemichiel. The herbalist was new, a pretty \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Redguard\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Redguard\u0022\u003ERedguard\u003C/a\u003E woman who tried to talk to him, even after he gave her the note reading \u0022My name is Thaurbad Hulzik and I have an appointment with Telemichiel for eleven o\u0027clock. Please forgive me for not talking, but I have no voicebox anymore.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Has it started raining yet?\u0022 she asked cheerfully. \u0022The diviner said it might.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThaurbad frowned and shook his head angrily. Why was it that everyone thought that mute people liked to be talked to? Did soldiers who lost their arms like to be thrown balls? It was undoubtedly not a purposefully cruel behavior, but Thaurbad still suspected that some people just liked to prove that they weren\u0027t crippled too.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe examination itself was routine horror. Telemichiel performed the regular invasive torture, all the while chatting and chatting and chatting.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You ought to try talking once in a while. That\u0027s the only way to see if you\u0027re getting better. If you don\u0027t feel comfortable doing it in public, you could try practicing it by yourself,\u0022 said Telemichiel, knowing her patient would ignore her advice. \u0022Try singing in the bath. You\u0027ll probably find you don\u0027t sound as bad as you think.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThaurbad left the examination with the promise of test results in a couple of weeks. On the ferry ride back home, Thaurbad began thinking of next week\u0027s temple bulletin. What about a double-border around the \u0022Last Sundas\u0027s Offering Plate\u0022 announcement? Putting the sermon in two columns instead of one might have interesting effects. It was almost unbearable to think that he couldn\u0027t get started on it until Alfiers sent him information.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen she did, it was with the note, \u0022LAST BULLETIN A LITTLE BETTER. NEXT TIME, DON\u0027T USE THE WORD \u0027FORTUITOUS\u0027 IN PLACE OF \u0027FORTUNATE.\u0027 THE WORDS ARE NOT, IF YOU LOOK THEM UP, SYNONYMOUS.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn response, Thaurbad almost followed Telemichiel\u0027s advice by screaming obscenities at Gorgos. Instead, he drank a bottle of cheap wine, composed and sent a suitable reply, and fell asleep on the floor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe next morning, after a long bath, Thaurbad began work on the Bulletin. His idea for putting a light shading effect on the \u0022Special Announcements\u0022 section had an amazing textural effect. Alfiers always hated the extra decorations he added to the borders, but using the Feyfolken quill, they looked strangely powerful and majestic.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGorgos came to him with a message from Alfiers at that very moment as if in response to the thought. Thaurbad opened it up. It simply said, \u0022I\u0027M SORRY.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThaurbad kept working. Alfiers\u0027s note he put from his mind, sure that she would soon follow it up with the complete message \u0022I\u0027M SORRY THAT NO ONE EVER TAUGHT YOU TO KEEP RIGHT-HAND AND LEFT-HAND MARGINS THE SAME LENGTH\u0022 or \u0022I\u0027M SORRY WE CAN\u0027T GET SOMEONE OTHER THAN A WEIRD, OLD MAN AS SCRIBE OF OUR BULLETIN.\u0022 It didn\u0027t matter what she was sorry about. The columns from the sermon notes rose like the massive pillars of roses, crowned with unashamedly ornate headers. The obituaries and birth announcements were framed together with a spherical border, as a heartbreaking declaration of the circle of life. The Bulletin was simultaneously both warm and avant-garde. It was a masterpiece. When he sent it off to Alfiers late that afternoon, he knew she\u0027d hate it, and was glad.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThaurbad was surprised to get a message from the Temple on Loredas. Before he read the content, he could tell from the style that it wasn\u0027t from Alfiers. The handwriting wasn\u0027t Alfiers\u0027s usual belligerent slashing style, and it wasn\u0027t all in Alfiers\u0027s usual capital letters, which read like a scream from \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Oblivion\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Oblivion\u0022\u003EOblivion\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Thaurbad, I thought you should know Alfiers isn\u0027t at the Temple anymore. She quit her position yesterday, very suddenly. My name is Vanderthil, and I was lucky enough (let me admit it now, I begged pitifully) to be your new Temple contact. I\u0027m overwhelmed by your genius. I was having a crisis of faith until I read last week\u0027s Bulletin. This week\u0027s Bulletin is a miracle. Enough. I just wanted to say I\u0027m honored to be working with you. -- Vanderthil.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe response on Sundas after the service even astonished Thaurbad. The archpriest attributed the massive increase in attendance and collection plate offerings entirely to the Bulletin. Thaurbad\u0027s salary was quadrupled. Gorgos brought over a hundred and twenty messages from his adoring public.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe following week, Thaurbad sat in front of his writing plank, a glass of fine \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Torval\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Torval\u0022\u003ETorval\u003C/a\u003Ei mead at his side, staring at the blank scroll. He had no ideas. The Bulletin, his child, his second-wife, bored him. The third-rate sermons of the archbishop were absolute anathema, and the deaths and births of the Temple patrons struck him as entirely pointless. Blah blah, he thought as he scribbled on the page.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe knew he wrote the letters B-L-A-H B-L-A-H. The words that appeared on the scroll were, \u0022A necklace of pearl on a white neck.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe scrawled a jagged line across the page. It appeared in through that damned beautiful Feyfolken quill: \u0022Glory to Auri-El.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThaurbad slammed the quill and poetry spilled forth in a stream of ink. He scratched over the page, blotting over everything, and the vanquished words sprung back up in different form, even more exquisite than before. Every daub and splatter caused the document to whirl like a kaleidoscope before falling together in gorgeous asymmetry. There was nothing he could do to ruin the Bulletin. Feyfolken had taken over. He was a reader, not an author.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow,\u0022 asked the Great Sage. \u0022What was Feyfolken from your knowledge of the School of Conjuration?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What happened next?\u0022 cried Vonguldak.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022First, tell me what Feyfolken was, and then I\u0027ll continue the story.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You said it was a daedra,\u0022 said Taksim. \u0022And it seems to have something to do with artistic expression.

When Gorgos returned with a new batch of congratulatory messages from the Temple, praising his latest Bulletin, he handed the note and the quill to the messenger boy. The note read: \u0022Take the quill back to the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Mages_Guild\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Mages Guild\u0022\u003EMages Guild\u003C/a\u003E and sell it.

It was white-feathered while his old quill had been dove gray. It felt good in his hand. He sighed with relief and waved his messenger lad away. He had a Bulletin to write, and this time, without any magic except for his own talent.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWithin two days time, he was nearly back on schedule. It looked plain but it was entirely his. Thaurbad felt a strange reassurance when he ran his eyes over the page and noticed some slight errors. It had been a long time since the Bulletin contained any errors. In fact, Thaurbad reflected happily, there were probably other mistakes still in the document that he was not seeing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe was finishing a final whirl of plain calligraphy on the borders when Gorgos arrived with some messages from the Temple.

Feyfolken script leapt from the letter and coursed over the scroll in a flood, translating his shabby document into a work of sublime beauty. Thaurbad no longer cared about the weird croaking quality of his voice. He screamed for a very long time. And then drank. Heavily.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGorgos brought Thaurbad a message from Vanderthil, the secretary of the Temple, early Fredas morning, but it took the scribe until mid-morning to work up the courage to look at it. \u0022Good Morning, I am just checking in on the Bulletin.

While his original draft, before Feyfolken had altered it, had been simple and flawed, the new copy was a scrawl. Lower-case I\u0027s were undotted, G\u0027s looked like Y\u0027s, sentences ran into margins and curled up and all over like serpents. Ink from the first page leaked onto the second page.

Friar Lylim gathered together every soldier who knew even the rudimentary secrets of Mysticism, who knew how to tap in to the elementary conundrums and knots of the energies of magicka. Though few were masters of the art, their combined force was powerful to behold. A great surge of entangling power washed over the army, crackling, hissing, and infusing all with their ghostly force. When they arrived at the gates, every soldier, even the least imaginative, knew that no spell would touch him for a long time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFriar Lylim watched his army batter into the gate with the great satisfaction of a commander who has counteracted an unthinkable attack with an outrageous defense.

As the flaming arrows fell upon the siegers like a red rain, the healers ran in to help the wounded. Their healing spells reflected off the dying men, one after the other. Chaos ruled as the attackers suddenly found themselves defenseless and began a panicked, unorganized retreat. Friar Lylim himself considered briefly holding his ground before fleeing himself.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELater, he would send furious notes to Lady Gialene and Kael, but they were returned.

In High Rock, Hammerfell, Cyrodiil, and possibly Morrowind, they did just that, and the Nedic peoples flourished and expanded over the last centuries of the Merethic Era. Only in Skyrim did this accommodation break down, an event recorded in the Song of Return. Perhaps, being close to reinforcements from Atmora, the proto-Nords did not feel it necessary to submit to the authority of the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Snow_Elf\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Snow Elf\u0022\u003ESkyrim Elves\u003C/a\u003E.

Whatever the case, the pattern was set -- in Skyrim, expansion would proceed militarily, with human settlement following the frontier of conquest, and the line between Human territory and Elven territory was relatively clear.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut beyond this \u0022zone of conflict\u0022, the other Nedic peoples continued to merge with their Elven neighbors.

Indeed, the Nords found it difficult to distinguish between Elf and Breton, the two races had already intermingled to such a degree. The arrival of the Nord armies upset the balance of power between the Nedic peoples and the Elves. Although the Nords\u0027 expansion into High Rock and Cyrodiil was relatively brief (less than two centuries), the result was decisive; from then on, power in those regions shifted from the Elves to the Humans.\u003C/p\u003E\n","Author":"University of Gwylim Press, 3E 344","Description":"Details the presence of humans in Tamriel prior to the original Nordic conquests thought to bring humans to Tamriel","Type":"","CoverImage":"SR-icon-book-BasicBook5.png"},{"Id":"0001ACCD","Title":"Galerion The Mystic","Text":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022D\u0022 src=\u0022//images.uesp.net/thumb/a/a4/D_letter.png/62px-D_letter.png\u0022 title=\u0022D\u0022 width=\u002262\u0022 height=\u002245\u0022 style=\u0022vertical-align: baseline\u0022 srcset=\u0022//images.uesp.net/thumb/a/a4/D_letter.png/93px-D_letter.png 1.5x, //images.uesp.net/thumb/a/a4/D_letter.png/124px-D_letter.png 2x\u0022\u003Euring the early bloody years of the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Second_Era\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Second Era\u0022\u003ESecond Era\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Vanus_Galerion\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Vanus Galerion\u0022\u003EVanus Galerion\u003C/a\u003E was born under the name Trechtus, a serf on the estate of a minor nobleman, Lord Gyrnasse of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Sollicich-on-Ker\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Sollicich-on-Ker\u0022\u003ESollicich-on-Ker\u003C/a\u003E.

Mercer had been spending inordinately large sums of coin on all manner of things unrelated to the Guild. How he was able to afford this was a mystery to me. The vault was impregnable, so what was the source of his coin?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s been confirmed by my sources. Mercer\u0027s been living an unduly lavish lifestyle replete with spending vast amounts of gold on personal pleasures. I have more than my share of evidence to confront him now.

Barenziah made it clear that she had no designs on reclaiming the throne, but merely to retire to her family estates.

Of course, in their cases, they might well have been on Helseth\u0027s own business, but I couldn\u0027t be certain. I had begun to think myself paranoid as the Prince himself when I found myself doubting the sincere loyalty of the Prince\u0027s chamberlain, Burgess, a Breton who had been in his employ since his days in the court of Wayrest.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is the background on that night, last night.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYesterday morning, I received a curt invitation to dine with the Prince. Based only on my own paranoia, I dispatched one of my servants, who is a good and loyal servant of the House Dres, to watch the palace and report back anything unusual. Just before dinner, he returned and told me what he had witnessed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA man cloaked in rags had been given entrance into the palace, and had stayed there for some time.

When he left, he was odorless.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe had come to the same conclusion as I did. The Prince had procured ingredients to prepare a poison. Bittergreen alone is deadly when eaten raw, but the other ingredients suggested something far deeper. As your unholiness can doubtless imagine, I went to dinner that night, prepared for any eventuality.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAll of Prince Helseth\u0027s other counselors were in attendance, and I noticed that all were slightly apprehensive. Of course, I imagined that I was in a nest of spies, and all knew of the Prince\u0027s mysterious meeting. It is just as likely that some knew of the alchemist\u0027s visit, while others were simply concerned by the nature of the Prince\u0027s invitation, and still others merely unconsciously adopted the tense disposition of their fellow, better informed counselors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Prince, however, was in fine mettle and soon had everyone relaxed and at ease. At nine, we were all ushered into his dining hall where the feast had been laid out. And what a feast!

Finally, the plates and food were cleared from the table, and a tureen of a spicy broth was placed in the center of the banquet.

Is it possible that the guilty party, or dare I say, parties were suspicious and merely pretended to eat and drink tonight? Of course. But even the craftiest of pretenders would have to raise a glass to his or her lips and put empty forks or spoons in their mouths to play the charade. The food, you see, was not poisoned. The cups and cutlery were.

No one knows better than his advisors both the depth of the Prince\u0027s paranoia and the utter implacability of his ambition. If I were not a spy for the House Dres, even then would I be safe? Could a loyalist be poisoned because of a not-so-innocent misjudgment?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe others must have been thinking the same, loyalists and spies alike.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile my mind whirled, I could hear the Prince\u0027s voice, addressing all assembled: \u0022The poison acts quickly.

The concerns of Gods in many ways may seem unrelated or at best unconcerned with the daily trials of the mortal realm. The exceptions do exist, however.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMany historical records and legends point to the direct intervention of one or more gods at times of great need. Many heroic tales recount blessings of the divinity bestowed upon heroic figures who worked or quested for the good of a Deity or the Deity\u0027s temple. Some of the more powerful artifacts in the known world were originally bestowed upon their owners through such reward. It has also been reported that priests of high ranking in their temples may on occasion call upon their Deity for blessings or help in time of need. The exact nature of such contact and the blessings bestowed is given to much speculation, as the temples hold such associations secret and holy. This direct contact gives weight to the belief that the Gods are aware of the mortal realm. In many circumstances, however, these same Gods will do nothing in the face of suffering and death, seeming to feel no need to interfere. It is thus possible to conclude that we, as mortals, may not be capable of understanding more than a small fraction of the reasoning and logic such beings use.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne defining characteristic of all Gods and Goddesses is their interest in worship and deeds. Deeds in the form of holy quests are just one of the many things that bring the attention of a Deity. Deeds in everyday life, by conforming to the statutes and obligations of individual temples are commonly supposed to please a Deity. Performance of ceremony in a temple may also bring a Deity\u0027s attention. Ceremonies vary according to the individual Deity. The results are not always apparent but sacrifice and offerings are usually required to have any hope of gaining a Deity\u0027s attention.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile direct intervention in daily temple life has been recorded, the exact nature of the presence of a God in daily mundane life is a subject of controversy.

It may even be theorized that the number of worshippers a given Deity has may reflect on His overall position among the other Gods. This my own conjecture, garnered from the apparent ability of the larger temples to attain blessings and assistance from their God with greater ease than smaller religious institutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are reports of the existence of spirits in our world that have the same capacity to use the actions and deeds of mortals to strengthen themselves as do the Gods. The understanding of the exact nature of such creatures would allow us to understand with more clarity the connection between a Deity and the Deity\u0027s worshipers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe implication of the existence of such spirits leads to the speculation that these spirits may even be capable of raising themselves to the level of a God or Goddess. \u003Ca href=\u0022/w/index.php?title=Skyrim:Motusuo\u0026amp;action=edit\u0026amp;redlink=1\u0022 class=\u0022new\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Motusuo (page does not exist)\u0022\u003EMotusuo\u003C/a\u003E of the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Imperial_Seminary\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Imperial Seminary\u0022\u003EImperial Seminary\u003C/a\u003E has suggested that these spirits may be the remains of Gods and Goddesses who through time lost all or most of their following, reverting to their earliest most basic form. \u003Cspan title=\u0022Please do NOT CHANGE to \u0026quot;Practitioners\u0026quot;: the original source is intentionally copied and has the error.\u0022 style=\u0022border-bottom:1px dotted\u0022\u003EPractioners\u0026#160;\u003Ci\u003E\u003Csmall\u003E[\u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/UESPWiki:Spelling#Quotes\u0022 title=\u0022UESPWiki:Spelling\u0022\u003Esic\u003C/a\u003E]\u003C/small\u003E\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E of the Old Ways say that there are no Gods, just greater and lesser spirits.

Two legions had been effectively annihilated, not counting the loss of the Eighth during the retreat from the Imperial City the previous year. Titus II knew that there would be no better time to negotiate peace, and late in 4E 175 the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion signed the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:White-Gold_Concordat\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:White-Gold Concordat\u0022\u003EWhite-Gold Concordat\u003C/a\u003E, ending the Great War.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe terms were harsh, but Titus II believed that it was necessary to secure peace and give the Empire a chance to regain its strength. The two most controversial terms of the Concordat were the banning of the worship of Talos and the cession of a large section of southern Hammerfell (most of what was already occupied by Aldmeri forces). Critics have pointed out that the Concordat is almost identical to the ultimatum the Emperor rejected five years earlier. However, there is a great difference between agreeing to such terms under the mere threat of war, and agreeing to them at the end of a long and destructive war. No part of the Empire would have accepted these terms in 4E 171, dictated by the Thalmor at swords-point. Titus II would have faced civil war.

That\u0027s right... it was yours truly. I\u0027ve done just about every kind of job you can imagine and I\u0027ve got the septims put away to prove it. How else could an ex-thief find the resources to publish his own book?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow that I have your attention, let\u0027s start with two of the most fundamental skills you\u0027ll need to sharpen if you want to make it as a cutpurse - \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Lockpicking\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Lockpicking\u0022\u003Epicking locks\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Pickpocket\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Pickpocket\u0022\u003Epicking pockets\u003C/a\u003E. And before you roll your eyes and throw this book aside in disgust, I can promise you that the easiest way you\u0027re going to get caught is by ignoring the basics - but if you can master these activities you\u0027ll find yourself swimming in coin.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPicking pockets is one of the easiest skills to learn, but you\u0027d be surprised how often I\u0027ve seen novice thieves muck it up. The lesson here is two-fold. First, know your surroundings and second, know your approach. Where and when you decide to go fishing is just as important as who you chose as your mark. Follow them a while, there\u0027s never a need to rush. Wait until they\u0027re somewhere isolated and out of earshot of any guards - but most importantly always know when to let the mark go. Getting pinched simply isn\u0027t worth the risk. There\u0027ll always be plenty of other marks who\u0027ll come along with their pockets full. As far as the approach goes, don\u0027t drop into your crouch until you are completely out of the mark\u0027s view - directly behind and preferably close to them. Don\u0027t spend too long deciding what you\u0027ll lift either. A good thief should be able to hit a mark and make off with something valuable in less than five seconds. Last of all, plying this trade at night will greatly reduce your chances of getting caught. If you have no other choice and you have to do it in the daylight, just make sure you aren\u0027t out in the open.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELockpicking is an art form that takes years to master. The important thing to remember is that no two are alike, each one behaving completely differently. As long as you keep your wits about you, and your patience, you\u0027ll find them easier to defeat than you\u0027d initially expect. Good picks are always essential. Make sure you have plenty of them tucked away in your pockets. Always take your time and keep a light touch on the picks. When the tumblers begin to fall into place, you should feel the pick tremble ever-so-slightly - this means you\u0027re near the sweet spot. Slow down at that point and only move the picks with the finest touch. If you blindly poke at the lock like an old man, all you\u0027re going to end up with is a bunch of broken picks and equally broken pride. As a last resort, if the lock is completely confounding you, there\u0027s always the option of smashing it. Just keep in mind that this is rarely successful and could potentially make a great deal of noise.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBy using my techniques, I\u0027m not merely suggesting you\u0027ll be a successful thief, I\u0027m giving you a solid guarantee. All it takes is a little bit of patience and a great deal of practice then maybe, just maybe, you\u0027ll become as successful as Wulfmare.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EIn my next volume, we\u0027ll move onto another important tool in your arsenal - sneaking.

It\u0027s been said, and truly, that much of the House\u0027s current power is based on Pasoroth\u0027s earnings as a warrior. Every week he held games at his castle, pitting his skill against the champions of the neighboring estates, and every week, he won something. His great skill wasn\u0027t in the use of weaponry, though he was decent enough with an axe and a long sword, but in his ability to move quickly and with great agility wearing a full suit of heavy mail. There were some who said that he moved faster while wearing armor than he did out of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Some months before this story begins, he had won the daughter of one of his neighbors, a beautiful creature named Mena who he had made his wife. He loved her very much, but he was intensely jealous, and with good reason. She wasn\u0027t very pleased with his husbandly skills, and the only reason Mena never strayed was because Pasoroth kept a close eye on her. She was, to put it kindly, naturally amorous and resentful of her position as a prize. Wherever he went, he always brought her with him. At the games, she was placed in a special box so that he could see her even while he competed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But his real competition, though he didn\u0027t know it, was from a handsome young armorer he also had won at one of his competitions. Mena had noticed him, and the armorer, whose name was Taren, had certainly noticed her.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This has all the makings of a dirty joke, Hallgerd,\u0022 said Xiomara, with a smile.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I swear that it\u0027s entirely true,\u0022 said Hallgerd. \u0022The problem facing the lovers was, of course, that they could never be alone. Perhaps because of this, it became a burning obsession to both of them. Taren decided that the best time for them to consummate their love was during the games. Mena feigned illness, so she didn\u0027t have to stay in the box, but Pasoroth visited the sickroom every few minutes between fights, so Taren and Mena could never get together. The sound of Pasoroth\u0027s armor clunking up the stairs to visit his sick wife gave Taren the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022He crafted his lord a new suit of armor, strong, and bright, and beautifully decorated. For his purposes, Taren rubbed the leg joints with luca dust so the more he sweated and the more he moved them, the more they\u0027d stick together. After a little while, Taren figured, Pasoroth wouldn\u0027t be able to walk very quickly, and wouldn\u0027t have enough time in between fights to visit his wife. But just in case, Taren also added bells to the legs which rung loudly when they moved, so the couple would be able to hear him coming in plenty of time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022When the games commenced the following week, Mena feigned illness again and Taren presented his lord with the new armor.

He was also quite intelligent and strong, which, combined with his invulnerability, caused many to call him, after his mother\u0027s omen, the Hope of the Redoran. Of course, any one who is called the Hope of the Redoran will eventually develop some taint of impertinence, and it wasn\u0027t long before he had enemies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHis worst enemy was his cousin Athyn, who had borne much abuse at the hands of Andas. Primary among the grudges was that Athyn had been sent to Rihad to complete his education at Andas\u0027s insistence. When Athyn returned from \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Hammerfell\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Hammerfell\u0022\u003EHammerfell\u003C/a\u003E, it was because of the death of his father, who had also been a councilor of the House. Athyn was old enough to take his seat in the Council, but Andas claimed the seat as well, saying that his cousin had been gone too long from Morrowind and didn\u0027t understand politics as he did. The majority of the House agreed with Andas, wanting to see the Hope of Redoran rise quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAthyn exercised his right to combat his cousin for the seat. No one thought he had any chance of winning, of course, but the battle was scheduled to commence the following morn. Andas whored and dined and drank with the councilors that night, confident that his place in the House was secured and the hopeful new dawn of House Redoran was rising. Athyn retired to his castle with his friends, Andas\u0027s enemies, and his servants he had brought from Hammerfell.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAthyn and his friends were discussing the duel morosely when one of his old teachers, a warrior called Shardie, came into the hall. She had grown quite proud of her student over the years in Hammerfell, proud enough to accompany him across the Empire to his family\u0027s lands, and wanted to know why they had so little confidence in his odds in the battle.

Andas\u0027s entrance brought a great cheer, for not only was he much beloved as the Hope of the Redoran, but as his victory was a foregone conclusion, most wanted to be in good standing with him. His shining mail and blade drew admiration and awe. By contrast, Athyn drew a gasp of surprise and only a smattering of polite applause. He appeared costumed and armed like a barbarian.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs Shardie had suggested, Athyn allowed Andas to attack first. The Hope of the Redoran was eager to finish the battle and take the power he deserved quickly. The blade pushed by Andas\u0027s mighty arm slashed across Athyn\u0027s chest, but shallowly, and before it could be counterswung, Athyn knocked it back with his own weapon. When Athyn attacked and wounded Andas, the Hope of the Redoran was so surprised by being hurt for the first time in his life, he dropped his sword.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe less said about the end of the battle, the better. Suffice it to say that Athyn, wielding a simple club, battered Andas to death without spilling a drop of blood.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAthyn took his father\u0027s seat as councilor, and it was then said that the hope in the omen referred to Athyn, not Andas. After all, had Andas not tried to take the councilor seat away from his cousin, Athyn, being not very ambitious, might have never tried to get it. It can certainly be argued that way, I suppose.\u003C/p\u003E\n","Author":"Turiul Nirith","Description":"A tale of a child blessed by a prophecy and the interpretation thereof","Type":"","CoverImage":"SR-icon-book-BasicBook3a.png"},{"Id":"000ED604","Title":"Horker Attacks","Text":"\n\u003Cp align=\u0022center\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/File:SR-book-Horkerscene.png\u0022 class=\u0022image\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022SR-book-Horkerscene.png\u0022 src=\u0022//images.uesp.net/8/8c/SR-book-Horkerscene.png\u0022 width=\u0022300\u0022 height=\u0022212\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022O\u0022 src=\u0022//images.uesp.net/thumb/d/dd/O_letter.png/51px-O_letter.png\u0022 title=\u0022O\u0022 width=\u002251\u0022 height=\u002245\u0022 style=\u0022vertical-align: baseline\u0022 srcset=\u0022//images.uesp.net/thumb/d/dd/O_letter.png/77px-O_letter.png 1.5x, //images.uesp.net/thumb/d/dd/O_letter.png/102px-O_letter.png 2x\u0022\u003En my travels through \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Skyrim\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Skyrim\u0022\u003ESkyrim\u003C/a\u003E I have run into many northern fisherman and hunters with intriguing tales of their encounters with \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Horker\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Horker\u0022\u003Ehorker\u003C/a\u003Es.

He could find only one way to honor his duty to protect his commanding officer. It was not easy convincing Commander Beatia that he should accompany her, but at last, she relented.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe sun hung low but still cast a diffused glow, illuminating the snow with a ghostly light, when the five men and one woman slipped through the boulders beneath the castle to the water\u0027s frozen edge. Beatia and Ascutus moved carefully and precisely, painfully aware of each dull crunch of chitin against stone. At their commander\u0027s signal, the four unarmored men dashed towards the north across the ice.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen her men had reached the first fragment of cover, a spiral of stone jutting a few yards from the base of the promontory, Beatia turned to listen for the sound of the army above. Nothing but silence. They were still unseen. Ascutus nodded, his eyes through the helm showing no fear. The commander and her lieutenant stepped onto the ice and began to run.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen Beatia had surveyed the bay from the castle ramparts, the crossing closest to shore had seemed like a vast, featureless plane of white. Now that she was down on the ice, it was even more flat and stark: the sheet of mist rose only up their ankles, but it billowed up at their approach like the hand of nature itself was pointing out their presence to their enemies. They were utterly exposed. It came almost as a relief when Beatia heard one of the warchiefs\u0027 scouts whistle a signal to his masters.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey didn\u0027t have to turn around to see if the army was coming. The sound of galloping hoofs and the crash of trees giving way was very clear over the whistling wind.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBeatia wished she could risk a glance to the north to see if her men were hidden from view, but she didn\u0027t dare. She could hear Ascutus running to her right, keeping pace, breathing hard. He was used to wearing heavier armor, but the chitin joints were so brittle and tight from years of disuse, it was all he could do to bend them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe rocky shore to the Ridge still looked at eternity away when Beatia felt and heard the first volley of arrows. Most struck the ice at their feet with sharp cracking sounds, but a few nearly found home, ricocheting off their backs. She silently offered a prayer of thanks to whatever anonymous shellsmith, now long dead, had crafted the armor. They continued to run, as the first rain of arrows was quickly followed by a second and a third.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Thank \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Stendarr\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Stendarr\u0022\u003EStendarr\u003C/a\u003E,\u0022 Ascutus gasped. \u0022If there was only leather in the keep, we\u0027d be pierced through and through. Now if only it weren\u0027t... so rigid...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBeatia felt her own armor joints begin to set, her knees and hips finding more and more resistance with every step. There could be no denying it: they were drawing closer toward the shore, but they were running much more slowly. She heard the first dreadful galloping crunch of the army charging across the floe toward them. The riders were cautious on the slippery ice, not driving their horses at full speed, but Beatia knew that they would be upon the two of them soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe old chitin armor could withstand the bite of a few arrows, but not a lance driven with the force of a galloping horse. The only great unknown was time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe thunder of beating hooves was deafening behind them when Ascutus and Beatia reached the edge of the shore. The giant, jagged stones that strung around the beach blockaded the approach. Beneath their feet, the ice sighed and crackled. They could not stand still, run forward, nor run back. Straining against the tired metal in the armor joints, they took two bounds forward and flew at the boulders.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first landing on the ice sounded an explosive crack. When they rose for the final jump, it was on a wave of water so cold it felt like fire through the thin armor. Ascutus\u0027s right hand found purchase in a deep fissure. Beatia gripped with both hands, but her boulder was slick with frost. Faces pressed to the stone, they could not turn to face the army behind them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut they heard the ice splintering, and the soldiers cry out in terror for just an instant. Then there was no sound but the whining of the wind and the purring lap of the water. A moment later, there were footsteps on the cliff above.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe four guardsmen had crossed the bay. There were two to pull Beatia up from the face of the boulder, and another two for Ascutus.

Initially relying heavily on the expertise of archaeologist Floronius, my ability to discern the difference for myself improved over time. Indeed, I was surprised to find that many areas of the city, far more than I would have believed, retained much of the original stonework. Work was clearly done to remedy the effects of the city being burned after the elves\u0027 assault, but I suspect they underestimated the durability of Nordic craftsmanship.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOr rather, that is what I initially thought. Perhaps it was a mistaken sense of pride in the accomplishments of these early men, or perhaps it was just my inexperience that led me to this conclusion. Something was amiss, though. Repeated attempts to consult the exceedingly perceptive archaeologist were unfruitful, often digressing into lectures on the bathing habits of Saarthal residents, or the average number of potted plants in homes. I was again forced to rely on my limited powers of observation and deduction.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so I have no conclusive results to report at this time.

Boethiah is a Warrior Princess who acts more overtly than any other Daedroth. After years of skulking and scheming, it felt good to perform acts for a mistress which had direct, immediate consequences. Besides, I liked it that Boethiah was a Daedra of the Dark Elves. Our cult would summon her on the day we called the Gauntlet, the 2nd of Sun\u0027s Dusk. Bloody competitions would be held in her honor, and the duels and battles would continue until nine cultists were killed at the hands of other cultists. Boethiah cared little for her cultists-she only cared for our blood. I do think I saw her smile when I accidentally slew my brother in a sparring session. My horror, I think, greatly pleased her.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI left the cult soon after that. Boethiah was too impersonal for me, too cold. I wanted a mistress of greater depth.

As the book prescribed, I called to her on her holy day, the 3rd of Hearth Fire. At last I had found the personal mistress I had so long desired. I strove to understand her labyrinthine philosophy, the source of her mysterious pain. Everything about her was dark and shrouded, even the way she spoke and the acts she required of me. It took years for me to understand the simple fact that I could never understand Nocturnal. Her mystery was as essential to her as savagery was to Boethiah or treachery was to Molag Bal. To understand Nocturnal is to negate her, to pull back the curtains cloaking her realm of darkness. As much as I loved her, I recognized the futility of unraveling her enigmas. I turned instead to her sister, Azura.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAzura is the only Daedra Princess I have ever worshipped who seems to care about her followers.

While it\u0027s still better to absorb the impact with a quarter inch of steel, it\u0027s best to try to just step out of the way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERemember, against \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Magic\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Magic\u0022\u003Espells\u003C/a\u003E your blocking is useless until you\u0027re trained.

And if you decide you\u0027re fancy and want to wield two blades, you can\u0027t block at all, so don\u0027t even try. Without both hands on the hilt you just won\u0027t have the strength to counter blows.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut, with a weapon in each hand you are much more likely to take your opponent down quickly. The best defense, some say.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo wield the blade there are some fundamentals. Quick strikes are always good, but can be repelled, so watch for your opponent\u0027s own defensive postures. Wait for an opening, or create one with your own heavy attacks. Hammers hit hardest but are slow. Same with maces and all blunt weaponry. Axes are a nice middle ground, while swords are the quickest but won\u0027t stagger your opponent as efficiently with the hard hits.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKeep an eye not to get too exhausted - always try to save a little of your strength to counter blows, or even run! Keep moving during a fight. Never let yourself get cornered or surrounded. Pick your threats - weak spellcasters that can hurt you quick are the first things I fell.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe shield is not only a defensive tool. Put your shoulder into it and bash your opponent. This sends them flying and opens them up for quick counter assaults. Even better, put extra weight into it and power bash your opponent. If they\u0027re small this will put them on their knees.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBigger opponents cannot be staggered by heavy attacks. Only the power bash will really knock them around and create openings for you to exploit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo again - block, counter, bash! Hit them when they\u0027re down! They\u0027ll show no mercy, so why should you? Battle is about the offense, about catching your foe early and never relenting. Keep moving, keep swinging. If you consider yourself overly powerful, pick up a two-handed weapon and see your foes fall before you like wheat stalks. They\u0027re slow and unwieldy, but they shatter bones and cleave flesh better than anything.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe graves are filled with many a mediocre swordsman.

The very best in \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Skyrim\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Skyrim\u0022\u003ESkyrim\u003C/a\u003E. Most recently we were given a job to attack a vineyard in The Aalto to force its owner, a man named Laernu, to sell to our employer, a man named Suoibud. Our payment was to be a gem of surpassing size and quality, quite famous and unmistakable.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0027We did as we were asked, and when we went to Suoibud to collect our fee, he told us he was unable to pay, due to a recent burglary. In the end, though, he saw things our way, and paid us an amount of gold almost equal to the worth of the prize jewel \u2026 It did not empty out his treasury entirely, but it meant he was unable to buy the land in the Aalto after all. So we were not paid enough, Suoibud has taken a heavy financial blow, and Laernu\u0027s prize crop of Jazbay has been temporarily destroyed for naught,\u0027 Laicifitra took a long, slow drink of her mead before continuing. \u0027Now, I wonder, could you tell me, how came you in the possession of the gem we were promised?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEslaf did not answer at once.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EInstead, he took a piece of bread from the plate of the savage bearded barbarian on his left and ate it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 he said, his mouth full. \u0027May I? Of course, I couldn\u0027t stop you from taking the gem even if I wanted to, and as a matter of fact, I don\u0027t mind at all. It\u0027s also useless to deny how it came into my possession. I stole it from your employer. I certainly didn\u0027t mean you or your noble knights any harm by it, but I can understand why the word of a thief is not suitable for one such as yourself.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0027No,\u0027 replied Laicifitra, frowning, but her eyes showing amusement. \u0027Not suitable at all.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0027But before you kill me,\u0027 Eslaf said, grabbing another piece of bread. \u0027Tell me, how suitable is it for noble knights such as yourself to be paid twice for one job? I have no honor myself, but I would have thought that since Suoibud took a profit loss to pay you, and now you have the gem, your handsome profit is not entirely honorable.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELaicifitra picked up the broom and looked at Eslaf. Then she laughed, \u0027What is your name, thief?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Eslaf,\u0027 said the thief.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0027We will take the gem, as it was promised to us. But you are right. We should not be paid twice for the same job. So,\u0027 said the warrior woman, putting down the broomstick. \u0027You are our new employer. What would you have your own army do for you?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMany people could find quite a few good uses for their own army, but Eslaf was not among them. He searched his brain, and finally it was decided that it was a debt to be paid later. For all her brutality, Laicifitra was an simple woman, raised, he learned, by the very army she commanded. Fighting and honor were the only things she knew.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen Eslaf left Kravenswold, he had an army at his beck and call, but not a coin to his name. He knew he would have to steal something soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs he wandered the woods, scrounging for food, he was beset with a strange feeling of familiarity. These were the very woods he had been in as a child, also starving, also scrounging. When he came out on the road, he found that he had come back on the kingdom where he had been raised by the dear, stupid, shy maid Drusba.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe was in Erolgard.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt had fallen even deeper into despair since his youth. The shops that had refused him food were boarded up, abandoned. The only people left were hollow, hopeless figures, so ravaged by taxation, despotism, and barbaric raids that they were too weak to flee. Eslaf realized how lucky he was to have gotten out in his youth.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was, however, a castle and a king. Eslaf immediately made plans to raid the treasury. As usual, he watched the place carefully, taking note of the security and the habits of the guards. This took some time. In the end, he realized there was no security and no guards.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe walked in the front door, and down the empty corridors to the treasury. It was full of precisely nothing, except one man. He was Eslaf\u0027s age, but looked much older.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0027There\u0027s nothing to steal,\u0027 he said. \u0027Would that there was.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKing Ynohp, though prematurely aged, had the same white blond hair and blue eyes like broken glass that Eslaf had. In fact, he resembled Suoibud and Laicifitra as well. And though Eslaf had never met the ruined landlord of the Aalto, Laernu, he looked him too. Not surprisingly, since they were quintuplets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0027So, you have nothing?\u0027 asked Eslaf, gently.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Nothing except my poor kingdom, curse it,\u0027 the King grumbled. \u0027Before I came to the throne, it was powerful and rich, but I inherited none of that, only the title. For my entire life, I\u0027ve had responsibility thrust on my shoulders, but never had the means to handle it properly. I look over the desolation which is my birthright, and I hate it. If it were possible to steal a kingdom, I would not lift a finger to stop you.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was, it turned out, quite possible to steal a kingdom. Eslaf became known as Ynohp, a deception easily done given their physical similarities. The real Ynohp, taking the name of Ylekilnu, happily left his demesne, becoming eventually a simple worker in the vineyards of The Aalto. For the first time free of responsibility, he fell into his new life with gusto, the years melting off him.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe new Ynohp called in his favor with Laicifitra, using her army to restore peace to the kingdom of Erolgard.

They were always interested in simple solutions, the easy way, but people like Yana were always looking for exceptions, possibilities, exotica.

Long after her fellow students had opened their test locks and moved on, Yana was still playing with hers. The fact that she always opened it eventually, no matter how advanced a lock it was, irked Arthcamu even further.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You are making things much too difficult,\u0022 he would roar, boxing her ears. \u0022Speed is of the essence, not merely technical know-how.

She had, after all, paid him in advance. Speed was doubtless an important factor for the picker trying to get somewhere he wasn\u0027t supposed to go with the city guard on patrol behind him, but Yana knew it wouldn\u0027t apply to her. She merely wanted the knowledge.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EArthcamu did everything he could think of to encourage Yana to move faster. She seemed to perversely thrive on his physical and verbal blows, spending more and more time on each lock, learning its idiosyncrasies and personality. Finally, he could bear it no longer. Very late one afternoon after Yana had dawdled over a perfectly ordinary lock, he grabbed the girl by her ear and dragged her to a room in the stronghold far from the other students, an area they had always been forbidden to visit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe room was completely barren, except for one large crate in the center. There were no windows and no other door except for the one leading in. Arthcamu slammed his student against the crate and closed the door behind her. There was a distinct click of the lock.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This is the test for my advanced students,\u0022 he laughed behind the door. \u0022See if you can escape.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYana smiled and began her usual slow process of massaging the lock, gaining information.

You see the crate behind you? It contains a \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Vampire\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Vampire\u0022\u003Evampire\u003C/a\u003E ancient who has been locked in here for many months. It is absolutely ravenous.

She knew he was an evil, horrible man, but to resort to murder to teach his pupil? The moment she heard a rustling in the crate, any doubts she had were erased. Ignoring all her usual explorations, she jammed her wire into the lock, thrust the pegs against the pressure plate, and shoved open the door.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EArthcamu stood in the hallway beyond, laughing cruelly, \u0022So, now you\u0027ve learned the value of fast work.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYana fled from Arthcamu\u0027s stronghold, fighting back her tears. He was certain that she would never return to his tutelage, but he considered that he had taught her at last a very valuable lesson. When she did return the next morning, Arthcamu registered no surprise, but inside he was seething.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027ll be leaving shortly,\u0022 she explained, quietly. \u0022But I believe I\u0027ve developed a new type of lock, and I\u0027d be grateful if you\u0027d give me your opinion of it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EArthcamu shrugged and asked her to present her design.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I was wondering if I might use the vampire room and install the lock. I think it would be better if I demonstrated it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EArthcamu was dubious, but the prospect of the tiresome girl leaving at last put him in an excellent and even indulgent mood. He agreed to give her access to the room. For all morning and most of the afternoon, she worked near the slumbering vampire, removing the old lock and adding her new prototype. Finally, she asked her old master to take a look.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe studied the lock with an expert eye, and found little to be impressed with.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This is the first and only pick-proof lock,\u0022 Yana explained. \u0022The only way to open it is to have the right key.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EArthcamu scoffed and let Yana close the door, shutting him in the room. The door clicked and he began to go to work. To his dismay, the lock was much more difficult than he thought it would be. He tried all his methods to force it, and found that he had to resort to his hated student\u0027s method of careful and thorough exploration.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I need to leave now,\u0022 called Yana from the other side of the door. \u0022I\u0027m going to bring the city guard to the stronghold. I know that it\u0027s against the rules, but I really think it\u0027s for the welfare of the villagers not to have a hungry vampire on the loose. It\u0027s getting dark, and even though you aren\u0027t able to unlock the door, the vampire might be less proud about using the key to escape. Remember when you said \u0027If I put the key to the lock right in front of you, you\u0027d still never get around to opening it\u0027?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Wait!\u0022 Arthcamu yelled back. \u0022I\u0027ll use the key!

Arthcamu began to work harder on the lock, but his hands were shaking with fear. With no windows, it was impossible to tell how late it was getting to be. Were minutes that were flying by or hours? He only knew that the vampire ancient would know.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe tools could not stand very much twisting and tapping from Arthcamu\u0027s hysterical hands. The wire snapped in the keyhole. Just like a student. Arthcamu screamed and pounded on the door, but he knew that no one could possibly hear him. It was while sucking in his breath to scream again, he heard the distinct creak of the crate opening behind him.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe vampire ancient regarded the master locksmith with insane, hungry eyes, and flew at him in a frenzy. Before Arthcamu died, he saw it: on a chain that had been placed around the vampire\u0027s neck while it had been sleeping was a key.\u003C/p\u003E\n","Author":"Porbert Lyttumly","Description":"How a pupil outlocks her cruel picklock instructor","Type":"Lockpicking skill book","CoverImage":"SR-icon-book-BasicBook3.png"},{"Id":"000ED608","Title":"Lost Legends","Text":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022T\u0022 src=\u0022//images.uesp.net/thumb/1/18/T_letter.png/44px-T_letter.png\u0022 title=\u0022T\u0022 width=\u002244\u0022 height=\u002245\u0022 style=\u0022vertical-align: baseline\u0022 srcset=\u0022//images.uesp.net/thumb/1/18/T_letter.png/66px-T_letter.png 1.5x, //images.uesp.net/thumb/1/18/T_letter.png/88px-T_letter.png 2x\u0022\u003Ehe history of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Skyrim\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Skyrim\u0022\u003ESkyrim\u003C/a\u003E is vast, predating even the most ancient records of man and \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Mer\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Mer\u0022\u003Emer\u003C/a\u003E.

Every slave he bought on the day he bought him or her was soundly whipped in the courtyard for a period of one to three hours, depending on the individual degree of independent spirit. The whip he used -- or had his castellan use -- was of wet, knotted cloth, which regularly drew blood but very seldom maimed. To his great satisfaction and personal pride, few slaves ever needed to be whipped more than once. The memory of their first day, and the sight and sound of every subsequent slave\u0027s first day, stayed with them throughout their lives.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen Brin bought his first \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Bosmer\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Bosmer\u0022\u003EBosmer\u003C/a\u003E slave, he ordered his castellan to whip him only for an hour.

The Bosmer had been a highwayman, though not one of any great notoriety, before he had been caught and sold into slavery as punishment. It seemed so extraordinary that a quiet fellow like Dob, who always looked respectfully downward at the sight of his superiors, could have been a criminal. Brin made up his mind to question him about it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You must have used some sort of weapon when you were robbing all those pilgrims and merchants,\u0022 Brin grinned as he watched Dob mop.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, sedura,\u0022 Dob replied humbly. \u0022A bow.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Of course. You Bosmeri are supposed to be very handy with those,\u0022 Brin thought a moment and then asked: \u0022A bit of a marksman, were you?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDob nodded humbly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You will tutor my son Wodilic in archery,\u0022 the master said after another moment\u0027s pause. Wodilic was twelve years of age and had been rather sadly spoiled by his mother, Brin\u0027s late wife. The boy was useless at swordplay, fearful of being cut. He embarrassed his father\u0027s pride, but the personality defect seemed ideally suited to the bow. Brin had his castellan purchase a finely wrought bow, several quivers of arrows, and ordered targets to be set up in the wildflower field next to the plantation house. In a few days time, the lessons began.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the first few days, the master watched Wodilic and Dob to be certain that the slave knew how to teach. He was pleased to see the boy learn the grips and the different stances. Business concerns, however, had to take precedence. Brin only had time to see to it that the lessons were continuing, but not how well they were progressing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was a month\u0027s time before the issue was reexamined. Brin and his castellan were reviewing the plantation\u0027s earnings and expenses, and they had come to the area of miscellaneous household costs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You might also check to see how many targets in the field need to be repaired.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I have already anticipated that, sedura,\u0022 said the castellan. \u0022They are in pristine condition.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022How is that possible?\u0022 Brin shook his head. \u0022I\u0027ve seen targets fall apart after only a few good shots. There shouldn\u0027t be anything left after a month\u0027s worth of lessons.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022There are no holes of any kind in the targets, sedura. See for yourself.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs it happened at that hour, the marksmanship lesson was underway. Brin walked across the field, watching Dob guide Wodilic\u0027s arm as the boy took aim at the sky. The arrow flew up into an arc, over the top of the target, burying itself in the ground. Brin examined the target and found it to be, as his castellan said, in pristine condition. No arrow had touched it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Master Wodilic, you must pull your right arm down further,\u0022 Dob was saying. \u0022And the follow-through is essential if you expect your arrow to gain any height.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Height?\u0022 Brin snarled. \u0022What about accuracy? Unless he\u0027s been secretly racking up a high kill ratio on birds, you haven\u0027t taught my son a thing about marksmanship.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDob bowed humbly. \u0022Sedura, first Master Wodilic must become comfortable with the weapon before he need worry about accuracy. In Valenwood, we learn by watching the bolt arc at different levels, in different winds, before we try very hard to strike targets.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBrin\u0027s face turned purple with fury: \u0022I\u0027m not a fool! I should have known not to trust a slave with my boy\u0027s education!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe master grabbed Dob and shoved him toward the plantation house. Dob, head down, began the humble, shuffling walk he had learned in his domestic duties. Wodilic, tears streaming down his face, tried to follow.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You stay and practice!\u0022 roared his father. \u0022Try aiming at the target itself, not at the sky! You are not coming back into the house until there is one hole in that damned bullseye!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe boy tearfully returned to practice, while Brin brought Dob into the courtyard and called for his whip. Dob suddenly broke away and scrambled to hide between some barrels in the center of the yard.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Take your punishment, slave! I should have never shown you mercy the day I bought you!\u0022 Brin bellowed, bringing the whip down on Dob\u0027s exposed back again and again. \u0022I have to toughen you up!

The wind has changed!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Stop confusing my son!\u0022 Brin screamed. \u0022You\u0027ll be in the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Saltrice\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Saltrice\u0022\u003Esaltrice\u003C/a\u003E fields if I don\u0027t beat you to death first!

Brin pursued him, raining down blows.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe boy\u0027s arrow sailed high over the target and kept climbing, reaching a pinnacle at the edge of the plantation house before coming down in a magnificent arc. Brin tasted the blood before he realized he\u0027d been hit. Gingerly, he raised his hands and felt the arrowhead protruding out of the back of his neck. He looked at Dob crouching under the wagon, and thought he saw a thin smile cross the slave\u0027s lips. Just for an instant before he died, Brin saw the face of the rogue highwayman on Dob.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bullseye, Master Wodilic!\u0022 Dob crowed.\u003C/p\u003E\n","Author":"Alla Llaleth","Description":"How a Bosmer slave teaches his master\u0027s son marksmanship","Type":"Archery skill book","CoverImage":"SR-icon-book-BasicBook3a.png"},{"Id":"000B3236","Title":"Master Illusion Text","Text":null,"Author":"","Description":"","Type":"","CoverImage":"SR-icon-book-MagesGuild.png"},{"Id":"000B3237","Title":"Master Illusion Text","Text":null,"Author":"","Description":"","Type":"","CoverImage":"SR-icon-book-MagesGuild.png"},{"Id":"000B3238","Title":"Master Illusion Text","Text":null,"Author":"","Description":"","Type":"","CoverImage":"SR-icon-book-MagesGuild.png"},{"Id":"000B3239","Title":"Master Illusion Text","Text":null,"Author":"","Description":"","Type":"","CoverImage":"SR-icon-book-MagesGuild.png"},{"Id":"000B716A","Title":"Medresi\u0027s Notes","Text":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cfont face=\u0022$HandwrittenFont\u0022\u003EThe Journal of Medresi Dran\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cfont face=\u0022$HandwrittenFont\u0022\u003EOn \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Angarvunde\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Angarvunde\u0022\u003EAngarvunde\u003C/a\u003E:\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cfont face=\u0022$HandwrittenFont\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhispers of this ancient temple have been few and far between, and most real knowledge seems similar to Angarvunde itself; buried and forgotten.

I could block for hours if need be, but it only takes a few minutes, or even seconds, for your opponent, used to battering, to leave a space open for your own strike.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What was the longest you\u0027ve ever had to defend yourself?\u0022 asked the wounded man.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I fought a man once for an hour\u0027s time,\u0022 said Mindothrax. \u0022He was tireless with his bludgeoning, never giving me a moment to do aught but block his strikes. But finally, he took a moment too long in raising his cudgel and I found my mark in his chest. He struck my shield a thousand times, and I struck his heart but once. But that was enough.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So he was your greatest opponent?\u0022 asked the medico.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh, indeed not,\u0022 said Mindothrax, turning his great shield so the silvery metal reflected his own face. \u0022There is he.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe next day, the battle recommenced. Chief Iymbez had brought in reinforcements from the islands to the south. To the horror and disgrace of the tribe, mercenaries, renegade horsemen and even some \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Reachmen\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Reachmen\u0022\u003EReachmen\u003C/a\u003E witches were included in the war. As Mindothrax stared across the field at the armies assembling, putting on his helmet and readying his shield and blade, he thought again of his poor mother. What had tortured her so? Why had she never been able to look at her son without grief?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBetween sunrise and sundown, the battle raged. A bright blue-sky overhead burned down on the combatants as they rushed against one another over and over again. In every melee, Mindothrax prevailed. A foe with an ax rained a series of strokes against his shield, but every one was deflected until at last Mindothrax could best the warrior. A spear maiden nearly pierced the shield with her first strike, but Mindothrax knew how to give with the blow, throwing her off balance and leaving her open for his counterstrike. Finally, he met a mercenary on the field, armed with shield and sword and a helm of golden bronze. For an hour and a half they battled.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMindothrax tried every trick he knew. When the mercenary tensed his left arm, he held back his strike. When his opponent rose his sword, his shield rose too and expertly blocked. For the first time in his life, he was battling another defensive fighter. Stationary, reflective, with energy to battle for days if need be. Occasionally, another warrior would enter into the fray, sometimes from Mindothrax\u0027s army, sometimes from his opponent\u0027s. These distractions were swiftly dispatched, and the champions returned to their fight.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs they fought, circling one another, matching block for blow and blow for block, it dawned on Mindothrax that here at last he was fighting the perfect mirror.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt became more a game, almost a dance, than a battle of blood. It was not until Mindothrax missed his own step, striking too soon, throwing himself off balance, that the promenade was ended. He saw, rather than felt, the mercenary\u0027s blade rip across him from throat to chest. A good strike. The sort he himself might have delivered.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMindothrax fell to the ground, feeling his life passing. The mercenary stood over him, prepared to give his worthy adversary the killing blow. It was a strange, honorable deed for an outsider to do, and Mindothrax was greatly moved. Across the battlefield, he heard someone call a name, similar to his own.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022/w/index.php?title=Skyrim:Jurrifax\u0026amp;action=edit\u0026amp;redlink=1\u0022 class=\u0022new\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Jurrifax (page does not exist)\u0022\u003EJurrifax\u003C/a\u003E!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe mercenary removed his helmet to answer the call. As he did so, Mindothrax saw through the slits of his helmet his own reflection in the man. It was his own close-set eyes, red and brown hair, thin and wide mouth, and blunt chin. For a moment he marveled at the mirror, before the stranger turned back to him and delivered the death stroke.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJurrifax returned to his commander and was well paid for his part in the day\u0027s victory. They retired for a hot meal under the stars in a garden by an old cairn that had previously been occupied by their foes.

I hope to meet him.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe witch saw the spirits before her and knew the truth that the twins had met already.

I was posted on lookout and saw parts of the conflict. I later spoke with both Khajiit and Bosmer who fought in the battle, and it will serve as an excellent example of how the Khajiit used a mixture of ground and tree units to win the war.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Khajiit began the fight in an unusual way by sending tree-cutting teams of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Cathay-Raht\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Cathay-Raht\u0022\u003ECathay-raht\u003C/a\u003E and the fearsome \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Senche-Tiger\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Senche-Tiger\u0022\u003ESenche-raht\u003C/a\u003E or \u0022Battlecats\u0022 into the outskirts of Valenwood\u0027s forests.

The Bosmer were thus goaded into splitting their forces into smaller groups.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Bosmer archers took up positions in the remaining trees whose branches were now twenty or more feet apart, allowing some light into the forest floor.

The Khajiit, even the enormous Senche-raht, were able to hide between this shelter and one of the larger trees.

They took up positions in the higher branches that could not hold a Bosmer\u0027s weight. When the signal came, they used their claws and either torches or spells of fire (accounts from the two survivors I spoke with vary on this point) to distract the archers while the battle on the ground took place.

For some this was an artistic transfiguration into the concrete, non-magical substance of the world. For others, this was a war in which all were slain, their bodies becoming the substance of the world. For yet others, this was a romantic marriage and parenthood, with the parent spirits naturally having to die and give way to the succeeding mortal races.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe agent of this communal decision was Lorkhan, whom most early myths vilify as a trickster or deceiver.

But it was so big there was nothing but, and thus it was coiled around and around itself, and the worlds to come slid across each other but none had room to breathe or even be. And so the worlds called to something to save them, to let them out, but of course there was nothing outside the First Serpent, so aid had to come from inside it; this was Akel, the Hungry Stomach. Akel made itself known, and Satak could only think about what it was, and it was the best hunger, so it ate and ate. Soon there was enough room to live in the worlds and things began. These things were new and they often made mistakes, for there was hardly time to practice being things before. So most things ended quickly or were not good or gave up on themselves. Some things were about to start, but they were eaten up as Satak got to that part of its body. This was a violent time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Pretty soon Akel caused Satak to bite its own heart and that was the end. The hunger, though, refused to stop, even in death, and so the First Serpent shed its skin to begin anew. As the old world died, \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Satakal\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Satakal\u0022\u003ESatakal\u003C/a\u003E began, and when things realized this pattern so did they realize what their part in it was. They began to take names, like \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Ruptga\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Ruptga\u0022\u003ERuptga\u003C/a\u003E or \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Tu%27whacca\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Tu\u0027whacca\u0022\u003ETuwhacca\u003C/a\u003E, and they strode about looking for their kin. As Satakal ate itself over and over, the strongest spirits learned to bypass the cycle by moving at strange angles. They called this process the Walkabout, a way of striding between the worldskins. Ruptga was so big that he was able to place the stars in the sky so that weaker spirits might find their way easier. This practice became so easy for the spirits that it became a place, called the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Far_Shores\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Far Shores\u0022\u003EFar Shores\u003C/a\u003E, a time of waiting until the next skin.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ruptga was able to sire many children through the cycles and so he became known as the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Tall_Papa\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Tall Papa\u0022\u003ETall Papa\u003C/a\u003E. He continued to place stars to map out the void for others, but after so many cycles there were almost too many spirits to help out. He made himself a helper from the detritus of past skins and this was \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Sep\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Sep\u0022\u003ESep\u003C/a\u003E, or Second Serpent. Sep had much of the Hungry Stomach still left in him, multiple hungers from multiple skins. He was so hungry he could not think straight. Sometimes he would just eat the spirits he was supposed to help, but Tall Papa would always reach in and take them back out. Finally, tired of helping Tall Papa, Sep went and gathered the rest of the old skins and balled them up, tricking spirits to help him, promising them this was how you reached the new world, by making one out of the old. These spirits loved this way of living, as it was easier. No more jumping from place to place. Many spirits joined in, believing this was good thinking. Tall Papa just shook his head.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Pretty soon the spirits on the skin-ball started to die, because they were very far from the real world of Satakal. And they found that it was too far to jump into the Far Shores now. The spirits that were left pleaded with Tall Papa to take them back. But grim Ruptga would not, and he told the spirits that they must learn new ways to follow the stars to the Far Shores now. If they could not, then they must live on through their children, which was not the same as before. Sep, however, needed more punishment, and so Tall Papa squashed the Snake with a \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Adamantine_Tower\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Adamantine Tower\u0022\u003Ebig stick\u003C/a\u003E.

While the rest of the new world was allowed to strive back to godhood, Sep could only slink around in a dead skin, or swim about in the sky, a hungry void that jealously tried to eat the stars.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003E\u003Cspan class=\u0022mw-headline\u0022 id=\u0022Cyrodiilic.C2.A0.5Bsic.5D_.22.22Shezarr.27s_Song.22.22.C2.A0.5Bsic.5D\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan title=\u0022Please do NOT CHANGE to \u0026quot;Cyrodilic\u0026quot;: the original source is intentionally copied and has the error.\u0022 style=\u0022border-bottom:1px dotted\u0022\u003ECyrodiilic\u0026#160;\u003Ci\u003E\u003Csmall\u003E[\u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/UESPWiki:Spelling#Quotes\u0022 title=\u0022UESPWiki:Spelling\u0022\u003Esic\u003C/a\u003E]\u003C/small\u003E\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E \u003Cspan title=\u0022Please do NOT EDIT this: the original source is intentionally copied and has the error.\u0022 style=\u0022border-bottom:1px dotted\u0022\u003E\u0022\u0022Shezarr\u0027s Song\u0022\u0022\u0026#160;\u003Ci\u003E\u003Csmall\u003E[\u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/UESPWiki:Spelling#Quotes\u0022 title=\u0022UESPWiki:Spelling\u0022\u003Esic\u003C/a\u003E]\u003C/small\u003E\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/h4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This was a new thing that \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Shezarr\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Shezarr\u0022\u003EShezarr\u003C/a\u003E described to the Gods, becoming mothers and fathers, being responsible, and making great sacrifices, with no guarantee of success, but Shezarr spoke beautifully to them, and moved them beyond mystery and tears.

And, for the most part, the Daedra Lords were well pleased with this arrangement, for they always had worshippers and servants and playthings close to hand. But, at the same time, they sometimes looked with envy upon the Mortal Realms, for though mortals were foul and feeble and contemptible, their passions and ambitions were also far more surprising and entertaining than the antics of the Lesser Daedra. Thus do the Daedra Lords court and seduce certain amusing specimens of the Mortal Races, especially the passionate and powerful.

So that he might know himself he created Anuiel, his soul and the soul of all things.

Aspects of the Aurbis then asked for a schedule to follow or procedures whereby they might enjoy themselves a little longer outside of perfect knowledge. So that he might know himself this way, too, Anu created Auriel, the soul of his soul. Auriel bled through the Aurbis as a new force, called time. With time, various aspects of the Aurbis began to understand their natures and limitations.

He outlined a plan to create a soul for the Aurbis, a place where the aspects of aspects might even be allowed to self-reflect. He gained many followers; even Auriel, when told he would become the king of the new world, agreed to help Lorkhan. So they created the Mundus, where their own aspects might live, and became the et\u0027Ada.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But this was a trick. As Lorkhan knew, this world contained more limitations than not and was therefore hardly a thing of Anu at all. Mundus was the House of Sithis. As their aspects began to die off, many of the et\u0027Ada vanished completely. Some escaped, like Magnus, and that is why there are no limitations to magic.

He introduced himself as Lord \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Naigon_Strale\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Naigon Strale\u0022\u003EStrale\u003C/a\u003E, ambassador to the Emperor himself, and their chief patron. It was Strale who had hired them, on the Emperor\u0027s behalf, as a gift to the King and the kingdom of Camlorn.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The March of Beauty is but a precursor to the Flower Festival tonight,\u0022 he said. Unlike the King, he did not have to yell to be heard. His voice was loud and precise in its natural modulations. \u0022I expect each of you to perform well, and justify the significant expense I\u0027ve suffered bringing you all the way up here. Now hurry, you must be dressed and in position on Cavilstyr Rock before the sun goes down.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ambassador needn\u0027t have worried. The women were all professionals, experts at getting dressed and undressed with none of the time-consuming measures less promiscuous females required. His manservant Gnorbooth offered his assistance, but found he had little to do. Their costumes were simplicity itself: soft, narrow sheets with a hole for their heads. Not even a belt was required, so the gowns were open at the sides exposing the frame of their skin.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo it was long before the sun had set that the prostitutes turned dancers were at Cavilstyr Rock. It was a great, wide promontory facing the sea, and for the occasion of the Festival of Flowers, a large circle of unlit torches and covered baskets had been arranged. As early as they were, a crowd of spectators had already arrived. The women gathered in the center of the circle and waited until it was time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGyna watched the crowd as it grew, and was not surprised when she saw the lady from the March approaching, hand-in-hand with a very old, very short white-haired woman. The old woman was distracted, pointing out islands out at sea. The blonde lady seemed nervous, unsure of what to say. Gyna was used to dealing with uneasy clients, and spoke first.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Good to see you again, madam. I am Gyna of Daggerfall.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m glad you bear me no ill will because of the whores, I mean horse,\u0022 the lady laughed, somewhat relieved. \u0022I am Lady Jyllia Raze, daughter of the King.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I always thought that daughters of kings were called princess,\u0022 smiled Gyna.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022In Camlorn, only when they are heirs to the throne. I have a younger brother from my father\u0027s new wife whom he favors,\u0022 Jyllia replied. She felt her head swim. It was madness, speaking to a common prostitute, talking of family politics so intimately. \u0022Relative to that subject, I must ask you something very peculiar. Have you ever heard of the Princess Talara?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGyna thought a moment: \u0022The name sounds somewhat familiar. Why would I have?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I don\u0027t know. It was a name I just thought you might recognize,\u0022 sighed Lady Jyllia. \u0022Have you been to Camlorn before?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022If I did, it was when I was very young,\u0022 said Gyna, and suddenly she felt it was her turn to be trusting. Something about the Lady Jyllia\u0027s friendly and forthcoming manner touched her. \u0022To be honest, I don\u0027t remember anything at all of my childhood before I was nine or ten. Perhaps I was here with my parents, whoever they were, when I was a little girl. I tell you, I think perhaps I was. I don\u0027t recall ever being here before, but everything I\u0027ve seen, the city, you, the King himself, all seem ... like I\u0027ve been here before, long ago.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELady Jyllia gasped and took a step back. She gripped the old woman, who had been looking out to sea and murmuring, by the hand. The elderly creature looked to Jyllia, surprised, and then turned to Gyna. Her ancient, half-blind eyes sparkled with recognition and she made a sound like a grunt of surprise. Gyna also jumped. If the King had seemed like something out of a half-forgotten dream, this woman was someone she knew. As clear and yet indistinct as a guardian spirit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I apologize,\u0022 stammered Lady Jyllia. \u0022This is my childhood nursemaid, Ramke.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s her!\u0022 the old woman cried, wild-eyed. She tried to run forward, arms outstretched, but Jyllia held her back. Gyna felt strangely naked, and pulled her robe against her body.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No, you\u0027re wrong,\u0022 Lady Jyllia whispered to Ramke, holding the old woman tightly. \u0022The Princess Talara is dead, you know that. I shouldn\u0027t have brought you here. I\u0027ll take you back home.\u0022 She turned back to Gyna, her eyes welling with tears. \u0022The entire royal family of Camlorn was assassinated over twenty years ago. My father was Duke of Oloine, the King\u0027s brother, and so he inherited the crown. I\u0027m sorry to have bothered you. Goodnight.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGyna gazed after Lady Jyllia and the old nurse as they disappeared into the crowd, but she had little time to consider all she had heard. The sun was setting, and it was time for the Flower Festival. Twelve young men emerged from the darkness wearing only loincloths and masks, and lit the torches. The moment the fire blazed, Gyna and all the rest of the dancers rushed to the baskets, pulling out blossoms and vines by the handful.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt first, the women danced with one another, sprinkling petals to the wind. The crowd then joined in as the music swelled. It was a mad, beautiful chaos. Gyna leapt and swooned like a wild forest nymph. Then, without warning, she felt rough hands grip her from behind and push her.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EShe was falling before she understood it. The moment the realization hit, she was closer to the bottom of the hundred foot tall cliff than she was to the top. She flailed out her arms and grasped at the cliff wall. Her fingers raked against the stone and her flesh tore, but she found a grip and held it. For a moment, she stayed there, breathing hard. Then she began to scream.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe music and the festival were too loud up above: no one could hear her - she could scarcely hear herself. Below her, the surf crashed. Every bone in her body would snap if she fell. She closed her eyes, and a vision came. A man was standing below her, a King of great wisdom, great compassion, looking up, smiling. A little girl, golden-haired, mischievous, her best friend and cousin, clung to the rock beside her.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The secret to falling is making your body go limp. And with luck, you won\u0027t get hurt,\u0022 the girl said. She nodded, remembering who she was. Eight years of darkness lifted.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EShe released her grip and let herself fall like a leaf into the water below.\u003C/p\u003E\n","Author":"Mera Llykith","Description":"Part one of the story of Princess Talara","Type":"","CoverImage":"SR-icon-book-BasicBook3a.png"},{"Id":"0001B018","Title":"Mystery of Talara, v 2","Text":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022S\u0022 src=\u0022//images.uesp.net/thumb/e/ee/S_letter.png/54px-S_letter.png\u0022 title=\u0022S\u0022 width=\u002254\u0022 height=\u002245\u0022 style=\u0022vertical-align: baseline\u0022 srcset=\u0022//images.uesp.net/thumb/e/ee/S_letter.png/82px-S_letter.png 1.5x, //images.uesp.net/thumb/e/ee/S_letter.png/108px-S_letter.png 2x\u0022\u003Ehe felt nothing, darkness enveloping her body and mind.

She had been pushed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFurther down current, she allowed herself to drift. There the steep cliff walls sloped lower until they were close to the water\u0027s edge. The silhouette of a large house on the shore loomed ahead, and as she neared it, she could see smoke rising from the chimney and the flicker of firelight within. The pain in her leg was great, but greater still was the chill of the water. The thought of a warm hearth fire was all the motivation she needed to begin swimming again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the shore\u0027s edge, she tried to stand but found she couldn\u0027t. Her tears mixed with the sea water as she began to crawl across the sand and rock. The simple white sheet which had been her costume at the Flower Festival was tattered and felt like a weight of lead across her back. Beyond the point of exhaustion, she fell forward and began to sob.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Please!\u0022 she cried. \u0022If you can hear me, please help!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA moment later, the door to the house opened and a woman stepped out.

By contrast, when the old woman came to her, this time there was no glimmer of recognition in her eyes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022By Sethiete, are you hurt?\u0022 Ramke whispered, and helped her up, acting as her crutch. \u0022I\u0027ve seen that gown before.

When she did, she felt vomit rise at the sight of the deep gash, fish-white dead flesh, plump and swollen. Thick arterial blood bubbled up, splashing on the floor in streams.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh dear,\u0022 said the old woman, returning to the fire. \u0022That must rather sting.

Her little heart just broke, and for a while, it looked like her mind did too.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What do you mean?\u0022 asked Gyna. \u0022What happened?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I don\u0027t know if I should tell a stranger this, but it\u0027s fairly well-known in Camlorn, and I really feel like I know you,\u0022 Ramke struggled with her conscience and then released. \u0022Jyllia saw the assassination, you see. I found her afterwards, hiding in that terrible blood-stained throne room, and she was like a little broken doll. She wouldn\u0027t speak, she wouldn\u0027t eat. I tried all my healing spells, but it was quite beyond my power. So much more than a scraped knee. Her father who was then Duke of Oloine sent her to a sanitarium in the country to get well.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That poor little girl,\u0022 cried Gyna.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It took her years to be herself again,\u0022 said Ramke, nodding. \u0022And, in truth, she never really returned altogether. You wonder why her father when he was made king didn\u0027t make her his heir? He thought that she was still not exactly right, and in a way, as much as I would deny it, he\u0027s correct to think so.

But maybe not. Sometimes it\u0027s best not to hope.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGyna stood up, finding her leg to be as strong as it looked to be. Her gown had dried, and Ramke gave her a cloak, insisting she protect herself against the cold night air. At the door, Gyna kissed the old woman\u0027s cheek and thanked her. Not only for the healing spell and for the cloak, but for everything else of kindness she had ever done.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe road close to the house went north and south. To the left was the way back to Camlorn, where secrets lay to which she alone held the key. To the south was Daggerfall, her home for more than twenty years.

Perhaps we never will.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m sorry, I always find myself giving long explanations to short questions. When Lord Strale asked if I would help, I should have begun by saying \u0027yes,\u0027\u0022 Lady Brisienna laughed at the change in Lord Strale and Gyna\u0027s expressions. \u0022I will help you, of course. But for this to turn out well, you must accomplish two things to the Emperor\u0027s satisfaction. First, you must prove with absolute certainty who is the power behind this plot you\u0027ve uncovered. You must get someone to confess.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And secondly,\u0022 said Lord Strale, nodding. \u0022We must prove that this is a matter worthy of His Imperial Majesty\u0027s consideration, and not merely a minor local concern.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELord Strale, Lady Brisienna, and the woman who called herself Gyna discussed how to accomplish their goals for a few hours more. When it was agreed what had to be done, Lady Brisienna took her leave to find her ally Proseccus. Strale and Gyna set off to the west, toward Camlorn. It was not long after beginning their ride through the woods that they heard the sound of galloping hoof beats far up ahead. Lord Strale unsheathed his sword and signaled for Gyna to position her horse behind him.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt that moment, they were attacked on all sides. It was an ambush. Eight men, armed with axes, had been lying in wait.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELord Strale quickly yanked Gyna from her horse, pulling her behind him. He made a brief, deft motion with his hands. A ring of flame materialized around them, and rushed outward, striking their assailants. The men roared in pain and dropped to their knees. Lord Strale jumped the horse over the closest one, and galloped at full speed westward.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I thought you were an ambassador not a mage!\u0022 laughed Gyna.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I still believe there are times for diplomacy,\u0022 replied Lord Strale.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe horse and rider they had heard before met them on the road. It was Gnorbooth. \u0022Milord, it\u0027s the royal battlemage! He found out you two were in Umbington!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022With considerable ease, I might add,\u0022 Lord Eryl\u0027s voice boomed out of the woods. Gnorbooth, Gyna, and Lord Strale scanned the dark trees, but they showed nothing. The battlemage\u0027s voice seemed to emanate from everywhere and nowhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m sorry, milord,\u0022 groaned Gnorbooth. \u0022I tried to warn you as soon as I could.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022In your next life, perhaps you\u0027ll remember not to trust your plans to a drunkard!\u0022 laughed Lord Eryl. He had them in his sight, and the spell was unleashed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGnorbooth saw him first, by the light of the ball of fire that leapt from his fingertips. Later, Lord Eryl was to wonder to himself what the fool had intended to do. Perhaps he was rushing forward to pull Lord Strale out of the path. Perhaps he was trying to flee the path of destruction, and had simply moved left when he should have moved right. Perhaps, as unlikely as it seemed, he was willing to sacrifice himself to save his master. Whatever the reason, the result was the same.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe got in the way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was an explosion of energy that filled the night, and an echoing boom that shook birds from the trees for a mile around. On the few square feet where Gnorbooth and his horse had stood was nothing but black glass. They had been reduced to less than vapor. Gyna and Lord Strale were thrown back. Their horse, when it recovered its senses, galloped away as fast as it could. In the lingering glowing aura of the spell\u0027s detonation, Lord Strale looked straight into the woods and into the wide eyes of the battlemage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Damn,\u0022 said Lord Eryl and began to run. The ambassador jumped to his feet and pursued.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That was an expensive use of magicka, even for you,\u0022 said Lord Strale as he ran. \u0022Don\u0027t you know well enough not to use ranged spells unless you are certain your target won\u0027t be blocked?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I never thought - that idiot -\u0022 Lord Eryl was struck from behind and knocked to the wet forest floor before he had a chance to finish his lamentation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It doesn\u0027t matter what you thought,\u0022 said Lord Strale calmly, flipping the battlemage around and pinning his arms to the ground with his knees. \u0022I\u0027m not a battlemage, but I knew enough not to use my entire reserve on your little ambush. Perhaps it\u0027s a matter of philosophy, as a government agent, I feel inclined toward conservatism.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What are you going to do?\u0022 whimpered Lord Eryl.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Gnorbooth was a good man, one of the best, and so I\u0027m going to hurt you quite a lot,\u0022 the ambassador made a slight movement and his hands began to glow brightly. \u0022That\u0027s a certainty. How much more I\u0027m going to hurt you after that depends on what you tell me.

Quietly, she sat down at the foot of the throne in the now empty audience chamber.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This young lady came to me, having completely recovered her memory, but the story she told was beyond incredible, I simply couldn\u0027t believe it,\u0022 said Lord Strale. \u0022But she was so convinced of it, I had to investigate. So I talked to everyone who was here at the palace twenty years ago to see if there could be any truth to it. Of course, at the time of the King and Queen\u0027s murder, and the Princess\u0027s disappearance, there was a full inquiry made, but I had different questions to ask this time. Questions about the relationship between the two little cousins, Lady Jyllia Raze and the Princess.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027ve told everyone over and over again, I don\u0027t remember anything at all about that time in my life,\u0022 said Jyllia, tears welling up.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I know you don\u0027t. There has never been a question in my mind that you witnessed a horrible murder, and that your memory lapse and hers,\u0022 said Lord Strale, gesturing toward Gyna \u0022Are both very real. The story I heard from the servants and other people at the palace was that the little girls were inseparably close. There were no other playmates, and as the Princess\u0027s place was to be close to her parents, so the little Lady Jyllia was always there as well. When the assassin came to murder the Royal Family, the King and Queen were in their bedroom, and the girls were playing in the throne room.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022When my memory came back to me, it was like opening a sealed box,\u0022 said Gyna solemnly. \u0022Everything was so clear and detailed, like it all happened yesterday not twenty years ago. I was on the throne, playing Empress, and you were hiding behind the dais, pretending you were in a dungeon I had sent you to. A man I had never seen burst into the room from the Royal bedchamber, his blade soaked in blood. He came at me, and I ran for my life. I remember starting to run for the dais, but I saw your face, frozen in fear, and I didn\u0027t want to lead him to you. So I ran for the window.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We had climbed on the outside of the castle before, just for fun, that was one of the first memories that came back to me when I was holding onto that cliff. You and I on the castle wall, and the King calling up to me, telling me how to get down. But that day, I couldn\u0027t hold on, I was trembling so much. I just fell, and landed in the river.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I don\u0027t know if it was entirely the horror of what I had seen, or that combined with the impact of the fall and the coldness of the water, but everything just went blank in my mind. When I finally pulled myself out of the river, many miles away, I had no idea who I was. And so it stayed,\u0022 Gyna smiled. \u0022Until now.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So you are the Princess Talara?\u0022 cried Jyllia.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Let me explain further before she answers that, because the simple answer would just confuse you, as it did me,\u0022 said Lord Strale. \u0022The assassin was caught before he managed to escape the palace - in truth, he had to know he was going to be caught. He confessed immediately to the murders of the Royal Family. The Princess, he said, he had thrown out the window to her death. A servant down below heard the scream, and saw something fly past his window, so he knew it to be true.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It was not for several hours that little Lady Jyllia was found by her nursemaid Ramke hiding behind the dais, coated with dust, shivering with fear, and unable to speak at all. Ramke was very protective of you,\u0022 Strale said, nodding to Jyllia. \u0022She insisted on putting you to your room right away, and sent word the Duke of Oloine that the Royal Family was dead, and that his daughter had witnessed the murders but survived.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m beginning to remember a little of that,\u0022 said Jyllia, wonderingly. \u0022I remember lying in bed, with Ramke comforting me. I was so muddled and I couldn\u0027t concentrate. I remember I just wanted it all to be play time still, I don\u0027t know why. And then, I remember being bundled up and taken to that asylum.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027ll all come back to you soon,\u0022 Gyna smiled. \u0022I promise. That\u0027s how I began to remember. I just caught one detail, and the whole flood began.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That\u0027s it,\u0022 Jyllia began to sob in frustration. \u0022I don\u0027t remember anything else except confusion. No, I also remember Daddy not even looking at me as I was taken away. And I remember not caring about that, or anything else.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It was a confusing time for all, so particularly so for little girls. Especially little girls who went through what you two did,\u0022 said Lord Strale sympathetically. \u0022From what I understand, as soon as he received the message from Ramke, the Duke left his palace at Oloine, gave orders for you to be sent to a private sanitarium until you\u0027d recovered from your ordeal, and set to work with his private guard torturing the assassin for information. When I heard that, that no one but the Duke and his personal guard saw the assassin after he gave his initial confession, and that no one was present but the Duke and his guards when the assassin was killed trying to escape, I thought that very significant.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I spoke with Lord Eryl, who I knew was one of those present, and I had to bluff him, pretending I had more evidence than I did. I got the reaction I was hoping for, though it was a dangerous gambit. At last he confessed to what I already knew to be true.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The assassin,\u0022 Lord Strale paused, and reluctantly met Jyllia\u0027s eyes, \u0022Had been hired by the Duke of Oloine to kill the Royal Family, including the Princess as heir, so that the crown might be passed to him and to his children.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJyllia stared at Lord Strale, aghast. \u0022My father -\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The assassin had been told that once the Duke had him in custody, he would be paid and a prison break would be arranged. The thug picked the wrong time to be greedy and try to get more gold. The Duke decided that it would be cheaper to silence him, so he murdered him then and there, so the man would never tell anyone what really happened,\u0022 Lord Strale shrugged. \u0022No tragic loss as far as murders go. In a few years\u0027 time, you returned from the sanitarium, a little shaken but back to normal, except for a complete absence of memory about your childhood. And in that time, the former Duke of Oloine had taken his brother\u0027s place as the King of Camlorn. It was no small maneuver.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No,\u0022 said Jyllia, quietly. \u0022He must have been very busy. He remarried and had another child. No one ever came to visit me in the sanitarium but Ramke.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022If he had visited and seen you,\u0022 said Gyna. \u0022This story might have turned out very differently.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What do you mean?\u0022 asked Jyllia.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This is the most amazing part,\u0022 said Lord Strale. \u0022The question has long been whether Gyna is the Princess Talara. When her memory returned, and she told me what she remembered, I put several pieces of evidence together. Consider these facts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The two of you look remarkably alike now after twenty years of living very different lives, and as little girls and constant playmates, you looked nearly identical.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022At the time of the assassination, the murderer who had never been there before, only saw one girl on the throne, who he assumed to be his quarry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The woman who found Lady Jyllia was her nursemaid Ramke, a creature of unstable mind and fanatical devotion to her charge - the type would never accept the possibility that her beloved little girl had been the one who disappeared. The nursemaid was the only single person who knew both Princess Talara and the Lady Jyllia who visited you while you were in the sanitarium.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Finally,\u0022 said Lord Strale, \u0022Consider the fact that when you returned to court from the sanitarium, five years had past, and you had grown from a child to a young lady. You looked familiar, but not quite the same as your family remembered you, which is only natural.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I don\u0027t understand,\u0022 cried the poor girl, her eyes wide, because she did understand. \u003Cspan title=\u0022Please do NOT CHANGE to \u0026quot;Her\u0026quot;: the original source is intentionally copied and has the error.\u0022 style=\u0022border-bottom:1px dotted\u0022\u003EHere\u0026#160;\u003Ci\u003E\u003Csmall\u003E[\u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/UESPWiki:Spelling#Quotes\u0022 title=\u0022UESPWiki:Spelling\u0022\u003Esic\u003C/a\u003E]\u003C/small\u003E\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E memory was falling together like a terrible flood.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Let me explain it like this,\u0022 said her cousin, wrapping her in her arms. \u0022I know who I am now.

He donned his guise of Gentleman With a Cane, and moved from place to place without being recognized. After eleven days and eleven nights, Sheogorath decided that life among mortals was even more boring than his otherworldly existence.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What can I do to make their lives more interesting?\u0022 he said to himself. At that same moment, a young woman nearby commented wistfully to herself, \u0022The sounds of the birds are so beautiful.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESheogorath silently agreed with her. Mortals could not make the beautiful and inspired calls of birds. Their voices were wretched and mundane. He could not change the nature of mortals, for that was the purview of other \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Daedric_Princes\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Daedric Princes\u0022\u003EDaedric Princes\u003C/a\u003E. However, he could give them tools to make beautiful sounds.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESheogorath took hold of the petulant woman and ripped her asunder. From her tendons he made lutes. From her skull and arm bones he made a drum. From her bones he made flutes. He presented these gifts to the mortals, and thus Music was born.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESheogorath and King Lyandir\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKing Lyandir was known to be an exceedingly rational man. He lived in a palace that was a small, simple structure, unadorned with art and ugly to look upon. \u0022I do not need more than this,\u0022 he would say. \u0022Why spend my gold on such luxuries when I can spend it on my armies or on great public works?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHis kingdom prospered under his sensible rule. However, the people did not always share the king\u0027s sense of practicality. They would build houses that were beautiful to look upon, although not necessarily very practical. They devoted time and energy to works of art. They would celebrate events with lavish festivals. In general, they were quite happy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKing Lyandir was disappointed that more of them did not follow his example and lead frugal, sensible lives. He brooded on this for many years. Finally, he decided that his subjects simply didn\u0027t understand how much more they could accomplish if they didn\u0027t waste time on those frivolous activities. Perhaps, he reasoned, they just needed more examples.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe king decreed that all new buildings must be simple, unadorned, and no larger than was necessary for their function. The people were not happy about this, but they liked their king and respected the new law. In a few short years, there were more plain buildings than ornate ones. The citizens used the money saved to make and buy even more lavish art and hold even more excessive celebrations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce again, King Lyandir decided to provide them a strict example of how beneficial it would be to use their time and resources for more practical purposes. He banned all works of art in the city. The people were quite put out by this, but they knew that their king was doing what he thought was best for them. However, human nature is not so easily denied. In a few more years the city was filled with plain, simple buildings, and devoid of any sort of art. However, the people now had even more money and time to devote to their parties and festivals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith a heavy heart, King Lyandir decided that his people were to be treated like children. And like all children, they needed rules and discipline laid down by great figures of authority to make them understand what was truly important in life. He decreed that there should be no revelry in the city. Singing, dancing, and music were all banned. Even food and drink were limited to water and simple foodstuffs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe people had had enough. Revolt was out of the question, since King Lyandir had a very well trained and equipped army. They visited the shrines and temples in droves, praying to all the gods, and even to some of the Daedric Princes, that King Lyandir would revoke these new, oppressive laws.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESheogorath heard their pleas and decided to visit King Lyandir. He appeared to the king in his dreams as a field of flowers, each with arms instead of petals and the face of the Madgod in the center. \u0022I am Lord of the Creative and Lord of the Deranged. Since you have no use for my gifts of creativity, I have decided to bless you with an abundance of my other gift.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom that day forward, every child born in the city was born into madness. Since infants do not reveal illnesses of the mind, it was several years before this was realized. The king\u0027s own son was among the victims, suffering from seizures and delusions. Yet, King Lyandir refused to change his ways.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen his son, Glint, was 12 years old, he stabbed his father while Lyandir was sleeping. With his dying breath, King Lyandir asked, \u0022Why?\u0022 His son replied, \u0022It is the most practical thing I could do.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe new, young king ordered all the palace servants slaughtered. He ordered a grand festival to celebrate his new reign and the repeal of Lyandir\u0027s laws. He served the crowds a stew made from the carcasses of the palace servants. He ordered the east facing walls of every building painted red, and the west facing walls painted in stripes. He decreed that all citizens wear ornate masks on the backs of their heads. He then burned down the palace and began construction of a new one.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the new palace, the young king ordered his personal chambers to not have any doors; for fear that small woodland creatures would attack him. He ordered that it have no windows for fear that the sun and moon were jealous of him and plotting his death.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd thus ended the line of King Lyandir. The people of the city returned to their grand works of art and raucous celebrations. They talked and acted as if they still had a living king, and even kept up the palace, using it to house and care for their mad children. Sheogorath was mightily pleased with this outcome. From that day forward the city was blessed with more than the normal number of gifted artists and deranged citizens.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Contest of Wills\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA mighty wizard named Ravate once walked the Winds of Time to find Lord Sheogorath. His intent was to win a favor from this most capricious of the Daedric Princes. Upon finding Sheogorath, Ravate spoke humbly to him, \u0022Lord Sheogorath, I beg a favor of you. I would gladly drive a thousand men mad in your name if you would but grant me the greater magical powers.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFortunately for Ravate, Sheogorath was in a playful mood. He proposed a game, \u0022I will grant your wish, if you are still sane in three days. During that time, I will do my utmost to drive you mad. It shall be great fun.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERavate was not so certain that he liked this new deal. He had been really looking forward to driving a thousand men mad. \u0022Lord Sheogorath, I regret having disturbed you with my shallow, selfish request. I withdraw my unfortunate plea and will humbly leave this place.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESheogorath just laughed, \u0022Too late, mighty Ravate. The game is afoot, and you must play.\u0022 Ravate fled, only to find that all exits from the Daedric realm were now sealed. He wandered aimlessly, constantly looking over his shoulder, jumping at every noise. Each moment brought new terror as he waited for Sheogorath to begin.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter three days, Ravate was convinced that every plant and animal was a tool of Sheogorath. He hadn\u0027t eaten or drunk for fear that Sheogorath had poisoned the food or drink. He hadn\u0027t slept for fear of Sheogorath invading his dreams. (Which was foolish, as dreams are the domain of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Vaermina\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Vaermina\u0022\u003EVaermina\u003C/a\u003E, may She grant us Restful Sleep.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was then that Sheogorath appeared to him. Ravate cried out, \u0022You have set the whole world to watching me! Every creature and plant are doing your bidding to drive me mad.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESheogorath replied, \u0022Actually, I have done nothing. You have driven yourself mad with your fears. Your delusions prove that you are truly deranged, and therefore I win. While you wanted to make a thousand men mad, I only wanted to break one man\u0027s mind, yours.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom that day forward Ravate served Sheogorath\u0027s every whim. Whenever daring travelers try to approach Sheogorath, Ravate warns them, \u0022Sheogorath is already inside each of us. You have already lost.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n","Author":"Mymophonus","Description":"Magical myths about the Madgod himself","Type":"","CoverImage":"SR-icon-book-BasicBook2.png"},{"Id":"0001AD0E","Title":"N\u0027Gasta!

The Dwemer were well-defended by their fortress at Red Mountain, but the bravery and cleverness of Nerevar\u0027s queen and generals drew most of Dumac\u0027s armies out into the field and kept them there, so that Nerevar and Dagoth-Ur could make their way into the Heart Chamber by secret means. There, Nerevar met Dumac and the Dwarf King and they both fell from grievous wounds.

Stay here, loyal Dagoth-Ur, until I return.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThen Nerevar told his queen and generals all that had transpired under Red Mountain and how the Dwemer had used special tools to turn their people into immortals and of the wondrous power of the Heart of Lorkhan. The Tribunal decided that the Chimer should learn how to use this power so that Nerevar might claim Resdayn and the world for their people. Nerevar did not expect or want this, so he asked his queen and generals to help him summon Azura yet again for her guidance. But the Tribunal had become as greedy as Kagrenac upon hearing of the power of the Heart and they coveted it. They made ritual as if to summon Azura as Nerevar wanted but Almalexia used poisoned candles and Sotha Sil used poisoned robes and Vivec used poisoned invocations. Nerevar was murdered.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThen Azura came forth anyway and cursed the Tribunal for their foul deeds.

And Azura knew this would be true and that it would take a long time before her power might bring Nerevar back. \u0022What you have done here today is foul beyond measure and you will grow to regret it, for the lives of gods are not what mortals think and matters that weigh only years to mortals weigh on gods forever.\u0022 And so that they might know forever their wicked deeds Azura changed the Chimer into Dunmer, and their skin turned ashen and their eyes into fire. \u0022Let this mark remind you of your true selves who, like \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Ghoul\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Ghoul\u0022\u003Eghouls\u003C/a\u003E, fed on the nobility, heroism, and trust of their king.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then the Tribunal went into Red Mountain and met with Dagoth-Ur.

In fact, the woman held the title of Night Mother, reserved for the highest ranking female member of the organization.

It was shortly after these events that the Dunmer woman claimed to hear the voice of Sithis himself. The Dread Lord, she claimed, was displeased. He was unhappy with the Morag Tong\u0027s lack of success. The Void, he told her, was hungry for souls - and it was her destiny to set things right.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so, according to Dark Brotherhood legend, Sithis visited the Night Mother in her bed chamber, and begat her five children.

For such an act was considered incomprehensible, even for a Night Mother of the Morag Tong.

The Morag Tong, now surviving only in Morrowind, was an artifact of a forgotten age. The Dark Brotherhood would marry business with death. The organization would grow in wealth and power, and the Void would swell with fresh souls. It was, the Night Mother told her Listener, the perfect arrangement.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the early days of the Dark Brotherhood, the bodies of the Night Mother and her children were recovered from their original burial site, and interred in a crypt beneath the site of her house.

When pressed for more information, the prisoner claimed that the Nightingales were warriors of Nocturnal and performed her bidding without question. He claimed his source was someone he knew within the Thieves Guild of Skyrim, but he refused to identify them by name, so his story was quickly dismissed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe second piece of evidence pointing to the existence of the Nightingales exists to this day just outside of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Riften\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Riften\u0022\u003ERiften\u003C/a\u003E. Discovered at the terminus of a short pathway off of the main road stands a stone of unidentified blackened material. Carved into its face is the same avian symbol previously found on the dark suit of armor.

To others, this symbol was once again dismissed as a hoax or simply a diversion created by the Thieves Guild.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe final, and most controversial sample of evidence is a passage found scrawled on the inside of a cell wall in \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Whiterun\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Whiterun\u0022\u003EWhiterun\u003C/a\u003E.

Although this curiously tenacious flora grows almost anywhere a significant body of water is present, it\u0027s extremely rare, and soon to become extinct. After years of extensive research, and the tireless efforts of my field assistant, I came into the possession of a large sampling of nirnroot. According to the theories presented by the noted Imperial Herbalist Chivius Regelliam, the nirnroot once flourished until a cataclysmic event severely reduced their numbers. Although many scholars reject the proposal that the Sun\u0027s Death event of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:First_Era#1E_668\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:First Era\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022white-space:nowrap\u0022\u003E1E 668\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E catastrophically affected plant life, Chivius felt that the nirnroot\u0027s normal growth cycle was interrupted by the lack of sun for a full year. Whereas other plant species tend to \u0022find a way,\u0022 the nirnroot\u0027s mysterious magical nature made it especially susceptible to this climate shift. While this may or may not be the case, it\u0027s certainly true that the recorded sightings of nirnroot are declining as the years pass.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EChivius\u0027s notes oddly describe the nirnroot as emitting a \u0022brilliant yellowish glow.\u0022 Contrary to this fact, the nirnroot of today has a soft, haunting blue-white glow. Subsequent studies by other scholars have failed to adequately explain this shift in hue. I propose that the nirnroot sensed its own impending extinction and therefore altered its metabolism in order to survive. One of the most glaring pieces of evidence of my theory is the presence of nirnroot in subterranean environments... places completely devoid of sunlight. Strangely, Chivius\u0027s notes fail to mention even a single instance of a subterrestrial nirnroot. How could this be? How could a surface-dwelling plant suddenly begin appearing in new locations radically different from its normal habitat?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe answer, my fellow alchemists, is ironically concealed within Chivius\u0027s own notes. Although he spends a great deal of time experimenting with the nirnroot in his laboratory, he overlooked an important part of a plant\u0027s growth cycle... its soil. Chivius was correct in assuming the volcanic eruption of Red Mountain contributed to the demise of the nirnroot, but I believe the ash from that mighty explosion did more than simply cloud the skies. When mixed with the fertile soil of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Cyrodiil\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Cyrodiil\u0022\u003ECyrodiil\u003C/a\u003E, this fine powder is the true cause of the nirnroot\u0027s astounding metamorphosis. Although little volcanic ash from that dark time remains, I have performed tests on samples sent to me from \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Vvardenfell\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Vvardenfell\u0022\u003EVvardenfell\u003C/a\u003E. Careful scrutiny of the samples revealed that they were rife with \u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Ash_Salts\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Ash Salts\u0022\u003Eash salt\u003C/a\u003E,\u0022 a highly magical substance. \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Dunmer\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Dunmer\u0022\u003EDunmer\u003C/a\u003E native to the Vvardenfell region were known to have used ash salt as an ingredient to cure the \u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:The_Blight\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:The Blight\u0022\u003EBlight\u003C/a\u003E,\u0022 an awful disease which decimated their realm hundreds of years ago. This unique property of the ash salt coupled with the nirnroot\u0027s inherent magic caused the radical change... in essence; the root \u0022healed itself.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn summation, it\u0027s clear that the nirnroot was dying and used a byproduct of its destructor to preserve itself. I feel the nirnroot has accomplished in a relatively short amount of time what it would take other species thousands of years to complete.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether you subscribe to my theory or not, one thing is certain; the nirnroot is on a path to destruction. It contains untapped potential to create potions the likes of which have never been seen in our day. I propose to you today that we divert a small portion of our funds to an expedition to collect some of these roots to study. I have outlined this proposal for your perusal after this section of the Symposium. Please, seriously consider this proposal before it becomes too late, and the nirnroot becomes nothing but a memory.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for your time.\u003C/p\u003E\n","Author":"Sinderion","Description":"A description of the enigmatic plant called Nirnroot","Type":"","CoverImage":"SR-icon-book-BasicBook7.png"},{"Id":"000ED161","Title":"Nords Arise!","Text":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Nord\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Nord\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022N\u0022 src=\u0022//images.uesp.net/thumb/7/76/N_letter.png/54px-N_letter.png\u0022 title=\u0022N\u0022 width=\u002254\u0022 height=\u002245\u0022 style=\u0022vertical-align: baseline\u0022 srcset=\u0022//images.uesp.net/thumb/7/76/N_letter.png/82px-N_letter.png 1.5x, //images.uesp.net/thumb/7/76/N_letter.png/108px-N_letter.png 2x\u0022\u003Eords\u003C/a\u003E Arise!

When constructing the final resting places of their noble class, these supposedly \u0022barbaric\u0022 people proved quite the opposite; developing some of the most sophisticated and clever defenses ever encountered. Coupled with the presence of the fearsome \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Draugr\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Draugr\u0022\u003Edraugr\u003C/a\u003E, these tombs have become quite a challenge for the would-be treasure hunter.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe most often-overlooked obstacles are the abundance of traps spread throughout the tombs. Ranging from simple tripwire-activated rock falls to complex pressure plate-triggered dart traps, the Nords utilize these devices abundantly. Most of the traps can be avoided by simply looking for the trigger mechanism and avoiding them. Since they are most often placed in areas where distractions abound, remember to keep your eyes to the floor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the keys to survival in a Nordic Ruin is through the clever use of these traps to gain an upper hand against its denizens. In many cases, it\u0027s trivial to lure them across the triggering mechanism in hopes that they\u0027ll fall victim to the trap\u0027s effect. This advantage can come heavily into play when encountering an oil trap. Using a ranged attack, lure your victim onto the oil and then loose an arrow at the fire pot hanging above. The moment the fire pot shatters, the entire pool of oil will ignite and engulf the enemy. Just be certain that you\u0027re standing clear of the oil yourself, or else this trick could end your expedition in an untimely manner.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps one of the most amazing engineering marvels of all to be found in the ruins has little to do with the traps designed to kill. Utilizing all manner of pull chains, levers, switches and pressure plates, some of the most frustrating obstacles can occur in the form of puzzles that could threaten to block your progress. Watch for the telltale signs of these barriers: groups of levers in a single place, rotating pillars with carvings on all faces and even large arrays of pressure plates covering the floor of a room. In most cases, the puzzle might take experimentation, in others the solution could actually be present elsewhere in the complex. It\u0027s recommended to keep a writing implement and a journal handy in the latter case.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough Nordic Ruins are commonly infested with vermin such as \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Skeever\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Skeever\u0022\u003Eskeever\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Spider\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Spider\u0022\u003Espider\u003C/a\u003Es, these creatures pale in comparison to the mighty draugr. These horrific, animated dead beings are commonly found as guardians in most of the tombs and will defend them mercilessly. Since the draugr tends to lay dormant until someone happens upon their resting place, it\u0027s advisable to keep an eye on any niches or \u003Cspan title=\u0022Please do NOT CHANGE to \u0026quot;sarcophagi\u0026quot;: the original source is intentionally copied and has the error.\u0022 style=\u0022border-bottom:1px dotted\u0022\u003Esarcophaguses\u0026#160;\u003Ci\u003E\u003Csmall\u003E[\u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/UESPWiki:Spelling#Quotes\u0022 title=\u0022UESPWiki:Spelling\u0022\u003Esic\u003C/a\u003E]\u003C/small\u003E\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E that you encounter. These undead beings animate rather rapidly and silently, so always watch your back - any remains you may have passed could suddenly animate and set upon you without warning.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe perils of the Nordic Ruin are not without reward. The burial chambers in some of the larger complexes have been known to contain all manners of riches, from gold coins to even the occasional enchanted weapon or armor. Never dismiss the small ceremonial urns that dot the ruins, they are commonly filled with ancient offerings of great value. There are rumors that most, if not all of these ruins contain large walls with magical inscriptions upon them, but these have yet to be confirmed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile this might seem like comprehensive guide to the ruins, there are certain to be dangers lurking within that remain undiscovered. Just be sure to always enter these tombs with plenty of equipment and a good, solid weapon by your side.

Magister Tendixus was an inveterate collector of worthless junk, but I was reprimanded any time I threw something away of the least possible value.

I came to understand that my instinct was correct: the disc was a genuine necromantic artifact. Though I couldn\u0027t understand most of the Magister\u0027s notes, I determined that he thought it to be a means of resurrecting a loved one from the grave.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESadly, the time came when the chamber had been categorized and cleared, and I was given another assignment, assisting in the stables of the Guild\u0027s menagerie. At least finally I was working with some of my fellow initiates and had the opportunity of meeting the common folk and nobles who came to the Guild on various errands. Thus was I employed when we were all invited to the Tales and Tallows ball.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the expected glamour of the evening were not enough, our hostess was reputed to be young, rich, unmarried orphan from \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Hammerfell\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Hammerfell\u0022\u003EHammerfell\u003C/a\u003E.

The initiates at the Guild gossiped like old women about the mysterious young lady\u0027s past, what had happened to her parents, why she had left or been driven from her homeland. Her name was Betaniqi, and that was all we knew.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe wore our robes of initiation with pride as we arrived for the ball. At the enormous marble foyer, a servant announced each of our names as if we were royalty, and we strutted into the midst of the revelers with great puffery. Of course, we were then promptly ignored by one and all. In essence, we were unimportant figures to lend some thickness to the ball. Background characters.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe important people pushed through us with perfect politeness. There was old Lady Schaudirra discussing diplomatic appointments to \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Balmora\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Balmora\u0022\u003EBalmora\u003C/a\u003E with the Duke of Rimfarlin.

No one looked our way even when we were right next to them. It was as if my skill at illusion had somehow rendered us all invisible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI took my flagon out to the terrace. The moons were doubled, equally luminous in the sky and in the enormous reflecting pool that stretched out into the garden. The white marble statuary lining the sides of the pool caught the fiery glow and seemed to burn like torches in the night. The sight was so otherworldly that I was mesmerized by it, and the strange \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Redguard\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Redguard\u0022\u003ERedguard\u003C/a\u003E figures immortalized in stone. Our hostess had made her home there so recently that some of the sculptures were still wrapped in sheets that billowed and swayed in the gentle breeze.

My parents both were great warriors, as I hope to be.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHer eyes went out to the lawn, to the statues.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Do the sculptures represent your parents?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That\u0027s my father Pariom there,\u0022 she said gesturing to a life-sized representation of a massively built man, unashamedly naked, gripping another warrior by the throat and preparing to decapitate him with an outstretched blade. It was clearly a realistic depiction. Pariom\u0027s face was plain, even slightly ugly with a low forehead, a mass of tangled hair, stubble on his cheeks. Even a slight gap in his teeth, which no sculptor would surely have invented except to do justice to his model\u0027s true idiosyncrasies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And your mother?\u0022 I asked, pointing to a nearby statue of a proud, rather squat warrior woman in a mantilla and scarf, holding a child.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh no,\u0022 she laughed. \u0022That was my uncle\u0027s old nurse. Mother\u0027s statue still has a sheet over it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know what prompted me to insist that we unveil the statue that she pointed to. In all likelihood, it was nothing but fate, and a selfish desire to continue the conversation. I was afraid that if I did not give her a project, she would feel the need to return to the party, and I would be alone again. At first she was reluctant. She had not yet made up her mind whether the statues would suffer in the wet, sometimes cold Cyrodilic climate. Perhaps all should be covered, she reasoned. It may be that she was merely making conversation, and was reluctant as I was to end the stand-off and be that much closer to having to return to the party.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a few minutes time, we tore the tarp from the statue of Betaniqi\u0027s mother. That is when my life changed forevermore.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EShe was an untamed spirit of nature, screaming in a struggle with a misshapen monstrous figure in black marble. Her gorgeous, long fingers were raking across the creature\u0027s face. The monster\u0027s talons gripped her right breast in a sort of caress that prefaces a mortal wound. Its legs and hers wound around one another in a battle that was a dance. I felt annihilated. This lithe but formidable woman was beautiful beyond all superficial standards. Whoever had sculpted it had somehow captured not only a face and figure of a goddess, but her power and will. She was both tragic and triumphant. I fell instantly and fatally in love with her.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI had not even noticed when Gelyn, one of my fellow initiates who was leaving the party, came up behind us. Apparently I had whispered the word \u0022magnificent,\u0022 because I heard Betaniqi reply as if miles away, \u0022Yes, it is magnificent. That\u0027s why I was afraid of exposing it to the elements.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThen I heard, clearly, like a stone breaking water, Gelyn: \u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Mara\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Mara\u0022\u003EMara\u003C/a\u003E preserve me.

I don\u0027t remember anything more of that night. Somehow I knew I was invited to dine the next evening, but my mind and heart had been entirely and forever more arrested by the statue.

But my great grandfather\u0027s heart was in the beauty of it, and his philosophy of using the best to honor the best passed down to us all. I would not have even considered having a lesser artist create the statues of my parents, even if it would have been more allegiant to my culture.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022They\u0027re all exquisite,\u0022 I said.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But you like the one of my mother most of all,\u0022 she smiled. \u0022I see you look at it even when you seem to be looking at the others.

We have a great many business interests and she was brilliant at managing everything. Certainly better than I am now. All it took was her smile and everyone obeyed, and those that didn\u0027t paid dearly. She was very witty and charming, but a formidable force when the need arose for her to fight. Hundreds of battles, but I can never remember a moment of feeling neglected or unloved. I literally thought she was too strong for death. Stupid, I know, but when she went to battle that -- that horrible creature, that freak from a mad wizard\u0027s laboratory, I never even thought she would not return.

My breath hung in the air in a mist before dissipating. Frightened I dropped the disc.

But the skilled enchanter is also a catalyst. The same mind that can create something new can also provoke greater power from something old.

But something dark and bestial, the reality of death I suppose, would always break across the dawning of my dream.

There were no clouds, but it rained most every night, so the vegetation on the island of Gorne was bewildering lush. The stones themselves seemed to glow with sunlight, and the ditches burned with white meadowsweet and parsleydown; all around him were soft smells of flower and tree untroubled by wind; the foliage was purple green, blue green, ash green, white green. The wide cupolas, twisting cobbled streets, and thatched roofs of the little village of Gorne, and massive bleached rock of Sandil House all were magical to him.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYet the dreams haunted his nights and the Song continued whether he was awake or not.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAgainst Aunt Ulliah\u0027s admonishments, Tay, Baynarah, and Vaster had breakfast outdoors every morning with the servants. Ulliah would hold an interior breakfast for herself and any visiting dignitaries: guests were rare, so she often ate alone.

She would merely quietly smile at the gossip, and look at Tay with almost frightening love and devotion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne day, after breakfast, Baynarah whispered to Tay and Vaster, \u0022We have to go to the hills on the other side of the island.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EShe had used such imperatives before and always had something wonderful to show: a waterfall, tucked away behind ferns and tall rocks; a sunny grove of figs; a discreet still some peasants had set up; a sickly oak, twisted into a kneeling human figure; a collapsed stone wall that they imagined was thousands of years old, the last refuge of a doomed princess they named Merella.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe three walked across through the forest until they came to a clearing. A few hundred feet beyond, the meadow sank to a dry creek bed, filled with small, smooth stones. They followed that into the dark woods where trees canopied high over their heads. Sporadic red and yellow blossoms burst along the moist underbrush, but they became rarer and rarer as the children marched on under the umbrageous oaks and elms. The air crackled with birds ticking a staccato choral piece, a minor chord of the Song.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Where are we going?\u0022 asked Tay.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s not where we\u0027re going, it\u0027s what we\u0027re going to see,\u0022 replied Baynarah.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe forest surrounded the three children completely, bathed them in its tenebrous hues, and breathed on them with wet chirrups and sighs. It was easy for them to imagine that they were within a monster, walking along its twisted spine of stones.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBaynarah scrambled up the steep hill and peered through the thick mass of shrub and tree. Tay lifted Vaster out of the creek bed and climbed out, gripping soft grass for support. There was no path through the forest here. Brambles and low hanging branches struck at them like the claws of chained beasts. The cries of the birds became ever more stentorious, as if angered at the invasion. One limb drew blood on Vaster\u0027s cheek, but he didn\u0027t cry out. Even Baynarah, who could pass like an ethereal creature through impenetrable forests, had a braid catch on a bramble, ruining the intricate pattern a servant had woven hours before. She paused to pull out the other braid, so her bright unruly tresses fell freely behind her. Now she was something wild, a nymph guiding the other two through her woodland domain. The Song began to beat like a wild pulse.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey were on a shelf of stone below a cliff overlooking a tremendous gorge, staring over an expanse of cinder. It looked like the scene of a tremendous battle, a holocaust of fire. Charred boxes, weaponry, animal bones, and detritus too annihilated to be identifiable littered the ground. Speechless, Tay and Vaster stepped into the black field. Baynarah smiled, proud that she had finally found something of true wonder and mystery.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What is this place?\u0022 asked Vaster at last.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I don\u0027t know,\u0022 Baynarah shrugged. \u0022I thought at first that it was some kind of ruin, but now I think it\u0027s a junk pile, just not like any junk pile I\u0027ve ever seen. Just look at this stuff.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe three began an unorganized survey of the dusty mounds of refuse. Baynarah found a twisted sword only lightly blackened by flame and began polishing it to read the inscriptions on the blade. Vaster amused himself by breaking brittle boxes with his hands and feet, imagining himself a giant of unbelievable strength. A battered shield attracted Tay: there was something about it that reverberated with the sound of the Song. He pulled it out, and wiped its surface clean.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027ve never seen that crest before,\u0022 said Baynarah, looking over Tay\u0027s shoulder.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I think I have, but I don\u0027t remember,\u0022 Tay whispered, trying to conjure the memory from his dreams.

As his hand moved over the surface, brushing away grit and dust, a key in the Song rose which sent a shiver through Tay\u0027s entire body. Baynarah ran over to look at Vaster\u0027s treasure, but Tay felt paralyzed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Where did you find that?\u0022 she gasped, gazing into the swirl beneath the crystal surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Over in that wagon,\u0022 Vaster gestured toward a heap of blackened wood, barely discernible from the other piles but for its cart spokes. Baynarah began digging into the half-collapsed structure, so only her feet could be seen. The Song built in potency, sweeping over Tay. He began walking toward Vaster slowly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Give me that,\u0022 he whispered in a voice he could barely recognize as his own.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No,\u0022 Vaster whispered back, his eyes locked on the colors reflected in the heart of the globe. \u0022It\u0027s mine.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBaynarah dug through the remains of the wagon for several more minutes, but she could find no treasures like Vaster\u0027s. Most everything within was destroyed, and what remained was common-place by any standards: broken arrows, armor shards, guar bones. Frustrated, she pulled herself out into the sunlight.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETay was alone, at the edge of the great gorge.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Where\u0027s Vaster?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETay blinked and then turned back to his cousin with a shrug and a grin: \u0022He went back to show everyone his new plunder.

Tay knew that Vaster would not be there when they got back. He would never be returning home again. The crystal globe rested snugly in Tay\u0027s satchel, hidden under a pile of junk he had picked up. With all his heart, he prayed for the Song to return and drown out the memory of the gorge and the long, silent fall down. The boy had been so surprised, he hadn\u0027t even time to scream.\u003C/p\u003E\n","Author":"Bristin Xel","Description":"Part 1 of an epic set in the aftermath of the war with the Dwemer and House Dagoth","Type":"","CoverImage":"SR-icon-book-BasicBook5.png"},{"Id":"xx02826f","Title":"The Poison Song, Book II","Text":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022T\u0022 src=\u0022//images.uesp.net/thumb/1/18/T_letter.png/44px-T_letter.png\u0022 title=\u0022T\u0022 width=\u002244\u0022 height=\u002245\u0022 style=\u0022vertical-align: baseline\u0022 srcset=\u0022//images.uesp.net/thumb/1/18/T_letter.png/66px-T_letter.png 1.5x, //images.uesp.net/thumb/1/18/T_letter.png/88px-T_letter.png 2x\u0022\u003Eay felt no guilt, which frightened him.

The tireless search through the woods as night turned to dawn. The weeping. The light punishment, merely cries of anger, that Baynarah and Tay suffered for losing their young cousin.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was thought, from their stricken expressions, that the children felt guilty enough. They were sent to bed at dawn while the hunt through the woods continued.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETay was drifting to sleep when his nursemaid Edebah came into his room. The look of unwavering love and devotion had not left her eyes, and he sank gratefully into his dreams and nightmares with her holding his hand. The Song wafted almost imperceptibly through his consciousness as he again had the vision of the room in the castle. The girl and her baby. The bird in the rafters. The dying fire. The sudden explosion of violence. Breathless, Tay opened his eyes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEdebah was stealing out the door, softly humming the Song to herself. In her hand was the crystal globe from his satchel. For a moment, he hesitated, about to cry out. How did she know the Song? Was she aware that he had murdered another boy to get the globe?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESomehow he knew that she was helping him, that she knew all and loved him and sought only to protect him.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe next day, and the next week, and the next month were all the same. No one spoke very much, and when they did it was to suggest new places to look for the missing boy. Everywhere had been searched thoroughly.

The younger boy\u0027s high spirits and meager attentiveness had always cut the lessons short, but sensible Baynarah and quiet Tay were ideal pupils. He was particularly impressed by how focused they became during a rather dry history lecture about the heraldic symbols of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Great_Houses\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Great Houses\u0022\u003EHouses of Morrowind\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The crest of the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:House_Hlaalu\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:House Hlaalu\u0022\u003EHlaalu\u003C/a\u003E features a scale,\u0022 he sniffed disdainfully. \u0022They see themselves as the great compromisers, as if that were something honorable.

At the height of day, all talk of curses and the evil Sixth House were pure supposition: something to add romance to one\u0027s life, but nothing to worry about. The two children walked back to the castle for yet another in a series of cold, quiet dinners. As the night fell, Baynarah looked through the treasures she had picked up in the junk heap. By the light of the moons, the small jars, the torc with orange gemstones, the bits of tarnished silver and gold of no obvious purpose, all took on a sinister aspect.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERevulsion overtook her feeling of admiration instantly.

The soft silken fabric slipped down slowly, exposing her dark, slender body to him for the first time. \u0022If we are, does incest particularly interest you now?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs they made love, the Song began a slow, rhythmic ascension in Tay\u0027s head. The vision of Acra before him darkened and was replaced by images from his nightmares before returning again. When finally he collapsed, spent, the room seemed filled with the fiery red clouds of his dream, and the scream of the woman and her child facing death echoed in his head. He opened his eyes, and there was Acra, smiling at him. Tay kissed her, grateful to have her in his arms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the next two weeks, Tay and Acra were never far apart.

Tay had bitterly joked about her madness, but he saw something close to it burning in her ancient eyes. \u0022You were not born of House Indoril; they brought you into their house after the War, like they and the other Houses brought in all the orphans. It was the only way they saw to erase history and remove all traces of their enemies, by raising their enemies as one of them.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETay turned toward the door: \u0022I can see why you were taken away from Gorne, old woman.

You slew that little boy Vaster because he possessed it, and I took it from your room because you were not ready to face the facts of your inheritance and responsibility then.

The creators and times of the rituals are long forgotten. But followed properly, the rite brings great power and prestige to the Huntsman.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ritual pits the all-powerful Huntsmen and their Greater and Lesser Dogs against the pitiful and doomed Innocent Quarry, called by tradition the Hare, after the mortal creature of human hunts. At once, the Huntsman is transported by the exquisite thrill and glory of his might and dominion over his helpless prey, and at the same time touched by the tragic, noble, and ultimately futile plight of the Innocent Quarry. In the highest aesthetic realization of the ritual, the ecstatic rapture of the kill is balanced by the Huntsman\u0027s identification with the sadness and despair of the Innocent Quarry. As in pieces the body of the innocent Hare is torn, the Huntsman reflects on the tragic imbalances of power and the cruel injustices of the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the Hunt begins, the Lesser Dogs assemble before the green crystal reflections of the Chapel of the Innocent Quarry. Inside the Chapel, the Huntsmen, the Greater Dogs, and the Master of the Hunt perform the rites that initiate and sanctify the Huntsmen, the Hunt, and the Innocent Quarry. Then the Huntsman emerges from the Chapel, displays the Spear of Bitter Mercy, and recites the Offices of the Hunt.

These practices and conditions, also known as the Law, strictly define all details of the Hunt, such as how many Hounds of each sort may participate, how the Spear of Bitter Mercy may be wielded, and so forth. In addition, the Law states that the Hare must have a genuine chance to escape the Hunt, no matter how slim. In practice, this condition has been defined as the availability of six keys, which, if gathered together in the Temple of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Daedra\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Daedra\u0022\u003EDaedric\u003C/a\u003E Rites, permit the Hare to teleport away from the Hunt, and so elude the Huntsman and his Spear. It is inconceivable, of course, that the Hare might actually discover the keys and escape, but the forms must be observed, and tampering with the keys or cheating the Hare of a genuine chance of finding or using the keys is a shameful and unforgivable betrayal of the Law of the Hunt.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Ritual of the Hunt grants the Huntsmen protection from all forms of attack, including mortal and immortal weapons, and sorceries of all schools. Huntsmen are cautioned, however, that the ritual does not protect the Huntsman from the potent energies of his own Spear, and cautions against reckless wielding of the Spear in close melee, darkness, or other dangerous circumstances, for a single touch of the Spear of Bitter Mercy means instant and certain death for innocent Hare or fellow Huntsman alike.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe right to name a Wild Hunt is a grand and grave right indeed, as all but the High \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Daedric_Princes\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Daedric Princes\u0022\u003EDaedra Lords\u003C/a\u003E are vulnerable to the potent sorceries of the Spear of Bitter Mercy.

And then, when I listened to them, bragging to one another, I realized that vanity was their weakness.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What did thou do?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022They had me chained at their camp in the woods not far from Cael, on a high knoll over-looking a wide river.

They were nodding in agreement, when I spoke up.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u0027I could swim that river and back in thirty minutes,\u0027 I said.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u0027Impossible,\u0027 said Koorg. \u0027I can swim faster than a little whelp like thee.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So it was agreed that we would dive off the cliff, swim to the center island, and return. As we went to our respective rocks, Koorg took it upon himself to lecture me about all the fine points of swimming. The importance of synchronized movements of the arms and legs for maximum speed. How essential it was to breathe after only third or fourth stroke, not too often to slow thyself down, but not too often to lose one\u0027s air. I nodded and agreed to all his fine points. Then we dove off the cliffs. I made it to the island and back in a little over an hour, but Koorg never returned. He had dashed his brains at the rocks at the base of the cliff. I had noticed the telltale undulations of underwater rocks, and had taken the diving rock on the right.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But thou returned?\u0022 asked Jalemmil, astounded. \u0022Was that not then when thou escaped?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It was too risky to escape then,\u0022 said Zarek. \u0022They could have easily caught me again, and I wasn\u0027t keen to be blamed for Koorg\u0027s disappearance. I said I did not know what happened to him, and after some searching, they decided he had forgotten about the race and had swum ashore to hunt for food. They could not see how I could have had anything to do with his disappearance, as fully visible as I was throughout my swim. The two brothers began making camp along the rocky cliff-edge, picking an ideal location so that I would not be able to escape.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022One of the brothers, Mathais, began commenting on the quality of the soil and the gradual incline of the rock that circled around the bay below. Ideal, he said, for a foot race. I expressed my ignorance of the sport, and he was keen to give me details of the proper technique for running a race. He made absurd faces, showing how one must breathe in through the nose and out through the mouth; how to bend one\u0027s knees to the proper angle on the rise; the importance of sure foot placement. Most important, he explained, was that the runner keep an aggressive but not too strenuous pace if one intends to win. It is fine to run in second place through the race, he said, provided one has the willpower and strength to pull out in the end.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I was an enthusiastic student, and Mathais decided that we ought to run a quick race around the edge of the bay before night fell. Ulin told us to bring back some firewood when we came back. We began at once down the path, skirting the cliff below. I followed his advice about breath, gait, and foot placement, but I ran with all my power right from the start. Despite his much longer legs, I was a few paces ahead as we wround the first corner.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022With his eyes on my back, Mathais did not see the gape in the rock that I jumped over. He plummeted over the cliff before he had a chance to cry out. I spent a few minutes gathering some twigs before I returned to Ulin at camp.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Now thou were just showing off,\u0022 frowned Jalemmil. \u0022Surely that would have been a good time to escape.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Thou might think so,\u0022 agreed Zarek. \u0022But thou had to see the topography\u0026#160;--\u0026#160;a few large trees, and then nothing but shrubs. Ulin would have noticed my absence and caught up with me in no time, and I would have had a hard time explaining Mathais\u0027s absence. However, the brief forage around the area allowed me to observe some of the trees close up, and I could formulate my final plan.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022When I got back to camp with a few twigs, I told Ulin that Mathais was slow coming along, dragging a large dead tree behind him. Ulin scoffed at his brother\u0027s strength, saying it would take him time to pull up a live tree by the roots and drop it on the bonfire. I expressed reasonable doubt.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u0027I\u0027ll show thee,\u0027 he said, ripping up a ten foot tall specimen effortlessly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u0027But that\u0027s scarcely a sapling,\u0027 I objected. \u0027I thought thou could rip up a tree.\u0027 His eyes followed mine to a magnificent, heavy-looking one at the edge of the clearing. Ulin grabbed it and began to shake it with a tremendous force to loosen its roots from the dirt. With that, he loosened the hive from the uppermost branches, dropping it down onto his head.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That was when I made my escape, mother,\u0022 said Zarek, in conclusion, showing a little schoolboy pride. \u0022While Mathais and Koorg were at the base of the cliff, and Ulin was flailing about, engulfed by a swarm.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJalemmil embraced her son once again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u003Cb\u003EPublisher\u0027s Note\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EI was reluctant to publish the works of Marobar Sul, but when the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:University_of_Gwylim_Press\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:University of Gwylim Press\u0022\u003EUniversity of Gwylim Press\u003C/a\u003E asked me to edit this edition, I decided to use this as an opportunity to set the record straight once and for all.\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EScholars do not agree on the exact date of Marobar Sul\u0027s work, but it is generally agreed that they were written by the playwright \u0022Gor Felim,\u0022 famous for popular comedies and romances during the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Interregnum\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Interregnum\u0022\u003EInterregnum\u003C/a\u003E between the fall of the First \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Cyrodiil\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Cyrodiil\u0022\u003ECyrodilic\u003C/a\u003E Empire and the rise of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Tiber_Septim\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Tiber Septim\u0022\u003ETiber Septim\u003C/a\u003E.

Other, less desirable Dark Elven traits evidently included pilfering, lying, and a little misplaced magic, just a small fire spell here and a little levitation spell there. And, as she grew older, a keen interest in boys and men, who could provide very pleasant sensations -- and to her aston\u00ADishment, gifts as well.

She could not help but feel superior to the Count and his Lady. There was something about them that provoked contempt.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfterward she came to learn that Sven and Inga were distant cousins of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Darkmoor\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Darkmoor\u0022\u003EDarkmoor Keep\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s last titled residents, and she finally understood. They were poseurs, impostors, not rulers at all. At least, they were not raised to rule. This thought made her strangely furious at them, a good clean hatred quite detached from resentment.

The same courier seldom came twice, but all of them looked her over in much the same way a farmer would look over a hog he is readying for market.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the spring of her sixteenth year, Barenziah thought the courier looked as if she were at last ready for market.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUpon reflection, she decided she did not wish to be marketed. The stable-boy, Straw, a big, muscular blond lad, clumsy, gentle, affectionate, and rather simple, had been urging her to run off for some weeks now. Barenziah stole the bag of gold the courier had left, took the mushrooms from the storeroom, dis\u00ADguised herself as a boy in one of Jonni\u0027s old tunics and a pair of his cast-off breeches... and on one fine spring night she and Straw took the two best horses from the stable and rode hard through the night toward \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Whiterun\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Whiterun\u0022\u003EWhiterun\u003C/a\u003E, the nearest city of any importance and the place where Straw wanted to be. But Mournhold and Morrowind also lay eastward and they drew Barenziah as a lodestone draws iron.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the morning they abandoned the horses at Barenziah\u0027s insistence. She knew they would be missed and tracked down, and she hoped to throw off any pursuers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey continued on foot until late afternoon, keeping to side roads, and slept for several hours in an abandoned hut. They went on at dusk and came to Whiterun\u0027s city gates just before dawn. Barenziah had prepared a pass of sorts for Straw, a makeshift document stating an errand to a temple in the city for a local village lord. She herself glided over the wall with the help of a levitation spell. She had reasoned-correctly, as it turned out-that by now the gate guards would have been alerted to keep an eye out for a young Dark Elven girl and a Nordic boy traveling together. On the other hand, unaccompanied country yokels like Straw were a common enough sight. Alone and with papers, it was unlikely that he would draw attention.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHer simple plan went smoothly. She met Straw at the temple, which was not far from the gate; she had been to Whiterun on a few previous occasions. Straw, however, had never been more than a few miles from Sven\u0027s estate, which was his birthplace.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETogether they made their way to a rundown inn in the poorer quarters of Whiterun. Gloved, cloaked, and hooded against the morning chill, Barenziah\u0027s dark skin and red eyes were not apparent and no one paid any heed to them. They entered the inn separately. Straw paid the innkeeper for a single cubicle, an immense meal, and two jugs of ale. Barenziah sneaked in a few minutes later.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey ate and drank together gleefully, rejoicing in their escape, and made love vigorously on the narrow cot. Afterward they fell into an exhausted, dreamless sleep.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ccenter\u003E***\u003C/center\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey stayed for a week at Whiterun. Straw earned a bit of money running errands and Barenziah burgled a few houses at night. She continued to dress as a boy. She cut her hair short and dyed her flame-red tresses jet black to further the disguise, and kept out of sight as much as possible. There were few Dark Elves in Whiterun.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne day Straw got them work as temporary guards for a merchant caravan traveling east.

The Emperor Tiber Septim I had done much in the way of building relatively safe and regularly patrolled highways.

But such were the perils of trade and profit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey had two such encounters before reaching Sunguard -- an ambush which Barenziah\u0027s keen ears warned them of in plenty of time for them to circle about and surprise the lurkers, and a night attack by a mixed band of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Khajiit\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Khajiit\u0022\u003EKhajiit\u003C/a\u003E, humans, and \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Bosmer\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Bosmer\u0022\u003EWood Elves\u003C/a\u003E. The latter were a skilled band and even Barenziah did not hear them sneaking up in time to give much warning. This time the fighting was fierce. The attackers were driven off, but two of the caravan\u0027s other guards were slain and Straw got a nasty cut on his thigh before he and Barenziah managed to gash his Khajiit assailant\u0027s throat.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBarenziah rather enjoyed the life. The garrulous sergeant had taken a liking to her, and she spent most of her evenings sitting around the campfire listening to his tales of campaigning in Morrowind with Tiber Septim and General Symmachus. This Symmachus had been made general after Mournhold fell, the sergeant said. \u0022He\u0027s a fine soldier, boy, Symmachus is. But there was more\u0027n soldiery involved\u0027n that Morrowind business, if y\u0027take my meanin\u0027.

Barenziah rather missed it too, but not as much as Straw did, seemingly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe sergeant wanted them to sign on for the return trip, but gave them a bonus nonetheless when they turned the offer down, and parchments of recommendation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EStraw wanted to settle down permanently near Sunguard, but Barenziah insisted on continuing their travels east. \u0022I\u0027m the Queen of Mournhold by rights,\u0022 she said, unsure whether it was true -- or was it just a daydream she had made up as a lost, bewildered child? \u0022I want to go home.

She\u0027d had a few adventures of that sort as they crossed Skyrim, when she\u0027d dressed as a woman and slipped away from Straw. She\u0027d only been looking for a bit of variety. Straw was sweet but dull. She\u0027d been startled, but extremely pleased, when the men she picked up offered her money afterward. Straw had been unhappy about it, though, and would shout for a while then sulk for days afterward if he caught her at it. He was quite jealous. He\u0027d even threat\u00ADened to leave her. Not that he ever did. Or could.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut the Imperial Guards were a tough and brutal lot by all accounts, and Barenziah had heard some very ugly stories during their treks. The ugliest of them by far had come from the lips of ex-army veterans around the caravan campfire, and were proudly recounted. They\u0027d been trying to shock her and Straw, she realized-but she also comprehended that there was some truth behind the wild tales. Straw hated that kind of dirty talk, and hated it more that she had to hear it. But there was a part of him that was fascinated never\u00ADtheless.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBarenziah sensed this and had encouraged Straw to seek out other women. But he said he didn\u0027t want anyone else but her. She told him candidly she didn\u0027t feel that way about him, but she did like him better than anyone else. \u0022Then why do you go with other men?\u0022 Straw had asked on one occasion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I don\u0027t know.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EStraw sighed. \u0022They say Dark Elven women are like that.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBarenziah smiled and shrugged. \u0022I don\u0027t know.

There were two quick, silent stabs of blue light, then Therris folded over into a still heap.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOutside the study the house had come alive with hastening footsteps and voices calling out in alarm and the clank of armor hurriedly put on.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe bigger man, a Dark Elf by the looks of him, half-lifted, half-dragged Therris to the door and thrust him into the waiting arms of another Elf.

And now she was going to pay for it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I daresay. It\u0027s unlikely that Therris had Guild approval for this. In fact, I wonder--\u0022 Symmachus examined the desk carefully, pulling out drawers. He selected one, placed it on top of the desk, and removed a false bottom. There was a folded sheet of parchment inside. It seemed to be a map of some sort. Barenziah edged closer.

Nor, for that matter, of you.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Then know this: Tiber Septim rewards friends and foes alike according to their deserts.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBarenziah chewed on that for a few moments. \u0022Straw has deserved well of me and has never done anyone any harm. He is not a member of the Thieves Guild. He came along to protect me. He earns our keep by running errands, and he ... he ...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESymmachus waved her impatiently to silence. \u0022Ai. I know all about Straw,\u0022 he said, \u0022and about Therris.\u0022 He stared at her intently. \u0022So? What would you?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EShe took a deep breath. \u0022Straw wants a little farm. If I\u0027m to be rich, then I would like for one to be given to him.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Very well.\u0022 He seemed astonished at this, and then pleased. \u0022Done. He shall have it. And Therris?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022He betrayed me,\u0022 Barenziah said coldly. Therris should have told her what risks the job entailed. Besides, he\u0027d pushed her right into their enemies\u0027 arms in an attempt to save himself. Not a man to be rewarded. Not, in fact, a man to be trusted.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes. And?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, he should be made to suffer for it ... shouldn\u0027t he?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That seems reasonable. What form should said suffering take?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBarenziah balled her hands into fists. She would\u0027ve liked to beat and claw at the Khajiit herself. But considering the turn events had taken, that didn\u0027t seem very queenly. \u0022A whipping. Er ... would twenty stripes be too many, do you think? I don\u0027t want to do him any permanent injury, you understand. Just teach him a lesson.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ai. Of course.\u0022 Symmachus grinned at this. Then his features suddenly set, and became serious. \u0022It shall be done, Your Highness, Milady Queen Barenziah of Mournhold.\u0022 Then he bowed to her, a sweeping, courtly, ridiculously wonderful bow.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBarenziah\u0027s heart leapt.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ccenter\u003E***\u003C/center\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EShe spent two days at Symmachus\u0027 apartment, during which she was kept very busy. There was a Dark Elven woman named Drelliane who saw to her needs, although she did not exactly seem a servant since she took her meals with them. Nor did she seem to be Symmachus\u0027 wife, or lover. Drelliane looked amused when Barenziah asked her about it. She simply said she was in the general\u0027s employ and did whatever was asked of her.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith Drelliane\u0027s assistance, several fine gowns and pairs of shoes were ordered for her, plus a riding habit and boots, along with other small necessities. Barenziah was given a room to herself.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESymmachus was out a great deal. She saw him at most mealtimes, but he said little about himself or what he had been doing. He was cordial and polite, quite willing to converse on most subjects, and seemed interested in anything she had to say. Drelliane was much the same. Barenziah found them pleasant enough, but \u0022hard to get to know,\u0022 as Katisha would have put it. She felt an odd twinge of disappointment. These were the first Dark Elves with whom she\u0027d associated closely. She had expected to feel comfortable with them, to feel at last that she belonged somewhere, with somebody, as part of something. Instead she found herself yearning for her Nordic friends, Katisha and Straw.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen Symmachus told her they were to set out for the Imperial City on the morrow, she asked if she could say good-bye to them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Katisha?\u0022 he asked. \u0022Ai. But then ... I suppose I owe her something. She it was who led me to you by telling me of a lonely Dark Elven girl named Berry who needed Elven friends -- and who sometimes dressed as a boy. She has no association with the Thieves Guild, apparently. And no one associated with the Thieves Guild seems to know your true identity, save Therris. That is well. I prefer that your former Guild membership not be made public knowledge. Please speak of it to no one, Your Highness. Such a past does not ... become an Imperial Queen.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No one knows but Straw and Therris. And they won\u0027t tell anyone.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No.\u0022 He smiled a curious little smile. \u0022No, they won\u0027t.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe didn\u0027t know that Katisha knew, then. But still, there was something about the way he said it ...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EStraw came to their apartment on the morning of their departure. They were left alone in the salon, although Barenziah knew that other Elves were within earshot. He looked drawn and pale. They hugged one another silently for a few minutes. Straw\u0027s shoulders were shaking and tears were rolling down his cheeks, but he said nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBarenziah tried a smile. \u0022So we both get what we want, eh? I\u0027m to be Queen of Mournhold and you\u0027ll be lord of your own farmstead.\u0022 She took his hand, smiled at him warmly, genuinely. \u0022I\u0027ll write you, Straw. I promise. You must find a scribe so you can write me too.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EStraw shook his head sadly. When Barenziah persisted, he opened his mouth and pointed at it, making inarticulate noises. Then she realized what it was. His tongue was gone, had been cut off.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBarenziah collapsed onto a chair and wept noisily.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ccenter\u003E***\u003C/center\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But why?\u0022 she demanded of Symmachus when Straw had been ushered away. \u0022Why?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESymmachus shrugged. \u0022He knows too much. He could be dangerous. At least he\u0027s alive, and he won\u0027t need his tongue to ... raise pigs or whatever.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I hate you!\u0022 Barenziah screamed at him, then abruptly doubled over and vomited on the floor. She continued to revile him between intermittent bouts of nausea. He listened stolidly for some time while Drelliane cleaned up after her. Finally, he told her to cease or he would gag her for her journey to the Emperor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey stopped at Katisha\u0027s house on their way out of the city. Symmachus and Drelliane didn\u0027t dismount. All seemed normal but Barenziah was frightened as she knocked on the door. Katisha answered the knock. Barenziah thanked the gods silently that at least she was all right. But she\u0027d also obviously been weeping. In any case, she embraced Barenziah warmly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Why are you crying?\u0022 Barenziah asked.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022For Therris, of course. You haven\u0027t heard? Oh dear. Poor Therris. He\u0027s dead.\u0022 Barenziah felt icy fingers creeping round her heart. \u0022He was caught stealing from the Commandant\u0027s house. Poor fellow, but that was so foolish of him. Oh, Berry, he was drawn and quartered this very dawn by the Commandant\u0027s order!\u0022 She started to sob. \u0022I went. He asked for me. It was terrible. He suffered so before he died. I\u0027ll never forget it. I looked for you and Straw, but no one knew where you\u0027d both gone to.\u0022 She glanced behind Barenziah. \u0022That\u0027s the Commandant, isn\u0027t it? Symmachus.\u0022 Then Katisha did a strange thing. She stopped crying and grinned. \u0022You know, the moment I saw him, I thought, This is the one for Barenziah!\u0022 Katisha took a fold of her apron and wiped it across her eyes. \u0022I told him about you, you know.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes,\u0022 Barenziah said, \u0022I know.\u0022 She took Katisha\u0027s hands in each of hers and looked at her earnestly. \u0022Katisha, I love you. I\u0027m going to miss you. But please don\u0027t ever tell anyone else anything about me. Ever. Swear you won\u0027t. Especially not to Symmachus. And look after Straw for me. Promise me that.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKatisha promised, puzzled though willing. \u0022Berry, it wasn\u0027t somehow because of me that Therris was caught, was it? I never said anything about Therris to ... to ... him.\u0022 She glanced over at the general.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBarenziah assured her that it wasn\u0027t, that an informant had told the Imperial Guard of Therris\u0027 plans. Which was probably a lie, but she could see that Katisha plainly needed some kind of comfort.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh, I\u0027m glad of that, if I can be glad of anything just now. I\u0027d hate to think-- But how could I have known?\u0022 She leaned over and whispered in Barenziah\u0027s ear, \u0022Symmachus is very handsome, don\u0027t you think? And so charming.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I wouldn\u0027t know about that,\u0022 Barenziah said dryly. \u0022I haven\u0027t really thought about it. There\u0027ve been other things to think about.\u0022 She explained hurriedly about being Queen of Mournhold and going to live in the Imperial City for a while. \u0022He was looking for me, that\u0027s all. On orders from the Emperor. I was the object of a quest, nothing more than some sort of... of a... goal. I don\u0027t think he thinks of me as a woman at all. He said I didn\u0027t look like a boy, though,\u0022 she added in the face of Katisha\u0027s incredulity. Katisha knew that Barenziah evaluated every male she met in terms of sexual desirability, and availability. \u0022I suppose it\u0027s the shock of finding out that I really am a queen,\u0022 she added, and Katisha agreed that yes, that\u0027s true, that must\u0027ve been something of a shock, although one there was no likelihood of her experiencing firsthand. She smiled. Barenziah smiled with her. Then they hugged again, tearfully, for the last time. She never saw Katisha again. Or Straw.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ccenter\u003E***\u003C/center\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe royal party left Rifton by the great southern gate. Once through, Symmachus tapped her shoulder and pointed back at the portals. \u0022I thought you might want to say good-bye to Therris too, Your Highness,\u0022 he said.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBarenziah stared briefly but steadily at the head impaled on a spike above the gate. The birds had been at it, but the face was still recognizable. \u0022I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll hear me, although I\u0027m quite sure he\u0027ll be pleased to know I\u0027m fine,\u0022 she said, seeming to sound light. \u0022Let\u0027s be on our way, General, shall we?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESymmachus was clearly disappointed by her lack of reaction. \u0022Ai. You heard of this from your friend Katisha, I suppose?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You suppose correctly. She attended the execution,\u0022 Barenziah said casually. If he didn\u0027t know already, he\u0027d find out soon enough, she was sure of that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Did she know Therris belonged to the Guild?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EShe shrugged. \u0022Everyone knew that. It\u0027s only lower-ranking members like me who are supposed to keep their membership secret. The ones higher up are well known.\u0022 She turned to smile archly at him. \u0022But you must know all that, shouldn\u0027t you, General?\u0022 she said sweetly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe seemed unaffected by this. \u0022So you told her who you were and whence you came, but not about the Guild.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The Guild membership was not my secret to tell. The other was. There\u0027s a difference. Besides, Katisha is a very honest woman. Had I told her, it would have lessened me in her eyes. She was always after Therris to take up a more honest line of work. I value her good opinion.\u0022 She afforded him a glacial stare. \u0022Not that it\u0027s any concern of yours, but do you know what else she thought? She also thought I\u0027d be happier if I settled down with just one man. One of my own race. One of my own race with all the right qualities. One of my own race with all the right qualities, who knows to say all the right things. You, in fact.\u0022 She grabbed the reins preparatory to assuming a brisker pace--but not without sinking one final irresistible barb. \u0022Isn\u0027t it odd how wishes come true sometimes--but not in the way you want them to? Or maybe I should say, not in the way you would ever want them to?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHis answer so took her by surprise that she quite forgot about cantering off. \u0022Yes. Very odd,\u0022 he replied, and his tone matched his words exactly. Then he excused himself and fell behind.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EShe held her head high and urged her mount onward, trying to look unimpressed. Now what was it about his response that bothered her? Not what he said. No, that wasn\u0027t it. But something about the way he said it. Something about it made her think that she, Barenziah, was one of his wishes that had come true. Unlikely as this seemed, she gave it due deliberation. He had found her at last, after months of searching, it seemed, under pressure from the Emperor, no doubt. So his wish had come true. Yes, that must be it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut in a way, apparently, not altogether to his liking.\u003C/p\u003E\n","Author":"Anonymous","Description":"Unauthorized biography of the famous Queen Mother of Morrowind, Volume 2","Type":"","CoverImage":"SR-icon-book-BasicBook2.png"},{"Id":"0001ACD8","Title":"The Real Barenziah, v3","Text":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022F\u0022 src=\u0022//images.uesp.net/thumb/9/92/F_letter.png/45px-F_letter.png\u0022 title=\u0022F\u0022 width=\u002245\u0022 height=\u002245\u0022 style=\u0022vertical-align: baseline\u0022 srcset=\u0022//images.uesp.net/thumb/9/92/F_letter.png/68px-F_letter.png 1.5x, //images.uesp.net/thumb/9/92/F_letter.png/89px-F_letter.png 2x\u0022\u003Eor several days, \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Barenziah\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Barenziah\u0022\u003EBarenziah\u003C/a\u003E felt a weight of sorrow at her separation from her friends.

Your Highness. If you are of no use to Tiber Septim, he will see to it that you are of no use to his enemies either,\u0022 the general said portentously. \u0022If you would keep your head on your shoulders, take heed.

Barenziah listened with growing interest, spurred on not entirely by his threats. But afterward she asked timidly if she might continue her study of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Magic\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Magic\u0022\u003Emagic\u003C/a\u003E while at the Imperial City. Symmachus seemed pleased at this and promised to arrange it. Encouraged, she then said that she noted three of their knights escort were women, and asked if she might train a little with them, just for the sake of exercise. The general looked less delighted at this, but gave his consent, though stressing it would only be with the women.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe late winter weather held fair, though slightly frosty, for the rest of their journey so that they traveled quickly over firm roads. On the last day of their trip, spring seemed to have arrived at last for there were hints of a thaw. The road grew muddy underfoot, and everywhere one could hear water trickling and dripping faintly but steadily. It was a welcome sound.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ccenter\u003E***\u003C/center\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey came to the great bridge that crossed into the Imperial City at sunset. The rosy glow turned the stark white marble edifices of the metropolis a delicate pink. It all looked very new and grand and immaculate.

A crowd of people of all sorts and races filled the wide concourse. Lights winked out in the shops and on in the inns as dusk fell and stars came out singly then by twos and threes. Even the side streets were broad and brightly illuminated. Near the Palace the towers of an immense \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Mages_Guild\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Mages Guild\u0022\u003EMages Guild\u003C/a\u003Ehall reared toward the east, while westward the stained glass windows of a huge tabernacle glittered in the dying light.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESymmachus had apartments in a magnificent house two blocks from the palace, past the temple.

He said that Barenziah would be expected to become a member should she prove acceptable to the Emperor.) The place was quite splendid--although little to Barenziah\u0027s taste. The walls and furnishings were done in utter pristine white, relieved only by touches of dull gold, and the floors in dully gleaming black marble. Barenziah\u0027s eyes ached for color and the interplay of subtle shadings.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the morning Symmachus and Drelliane escorted her to the Imperial Palace. Barenziah noted that everyone they met greeted Symmachus with a deferential respect in some cases bordering on obsequiousness. The general seemed to take it for granted.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey were ushered directly into the imperial presence. Morning sun flooded a small room through a large window with tiny panes, washing over a sumptuously laden breakfast table and the single man who sat there, dark against the light. He leapt to his feet as they entered and hurried toward them. \u0022Ah, Symmachus our most loyal friend, we welcome your return most gladly.\u0022 His hands held Symmachus\u0027 shoulders briefly, fondly, halting the deep genuflection the Dark Elf had been in the process of effecting.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBarenziah curtseyed as Tiber Septim turned to her.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Barenziah, our naughty little runaway. How do you do, child? Here, let us have a look at you. Why, Symmachus, she\u0027s charming, absolutely charming. Why have you hidden her from us all these years? Is the light too much, child? Shall we draw the hangings? Yes, of course.\u0022 He waved aside Symmachus\u0027 protests and drew the curtains himself, not troubling to summon a servant. \u0022You will pardon us for this discourtesy toward yourselves, our dear guests. We\u0027ve much to think of, though that\u0027s scant excuse for hospitality\u0027s neglect. But ah! pray join us.

Barenziah was dumbfounded. Tiber Septim was nothing like the grim, grey, giant warrior she\u0027d pictured. He was of average height, fully half a head shorter than tall Sym\u00ADmachus, although he was well-knit of figure and lithe of movement. He had a winning smile, bright -- indeed piercing -- blue eyes, and a full head of stark white hair above a lined and weathered face. He might have been any age from forty to sixty. He pressed food and drink upon them, then repeated the question the gen\u00ADeral had asked her days ago: Why had she left home? Had her guardians been unkind to her?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No, Excellency,\u0022 Barenziah replied, \u0022in truth, no -- although I fancied so at times.\u0022 Symmachus had fabricated a story for her, and Barenziah told it now, although with a certain misgiving. The stable-boy, Straw, had convinced her that her guardians, unable to find a suitable husband for her, meant to sell her off as a concubine in \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Rihad\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Rihad\u0022\u003ERihad\u003C/a\u003E; and when a Redguard had indeed come, she had panicked and fled with Straw.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETiber Septim seemed fascinated and listened raptly as she provided details of her life as a merchant caravan escort. \u0022Why, \u0027tis like a ballad!\u0022 he said. \u0022By \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:The_One\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:The One\u0022\u003Ethe One\u003C/a\u003E, we\u0027ll have the Court Bard set it to music. What a charming boy you must have made.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022General Symmachus said--\u0022 Barenziah stopped in some confusion, then proceeded. \u0022He said -- well, that I no longer look much like a boy. I have... grown in the past few months.\u0022 She lowered her gaze in what she hoped approximated maidenly modesty.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022He\u0027s a very discerning fellow, is our loyal friend Symmachus.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I know I\u0027ve been a very foolish girl, Excellency. I must crave your pardon, and that of my kind guardians. I... I realized that some time ago, but I was too ashamed to go back home. But I don\u0027t want to return to Darkmoor now. Excellency, I long for \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Mournhold\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Mournhold\u0022\u003EMournhold\u003C/a\u003E. My soul pines for my own country.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Our dear child. You shall go home, we promise you. But we pray you remain with us a little longer, that you may prepare yourself for the grave and solemn task with which we shall charge you.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBarenziah gazed at him earnestly, heart beating fast. It was all working just as Symmachus had said it would. She felt a warm flush of gratitude toward him, but was careful to keep her attention focused on the Emperor. \u0022I am honored, Excellency, and wish most earnestly to serve you and this great \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Third_Empire\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Third Empire\u0022\u003EEmpire\u003C/a\u003E you have built in any way I can.\u0022 It was the politic thing to say, to be sure -- but Barenziah really meant it. She was awed at the magnificence of the city and the discipline and order evident everywhere, and moreover was excited at the prospect of being a part of it all. And she felt quite taken by the gentle Tiber Septim.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ccenter\u003E***\u003C/center\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter a few days Symmachus left for Mournhold to take up the duties of a governor until Barenziah was ready to assume the throne, after which he would become her Prime Minister. Barenziah, with Drelliane as chaperone, took up residence in a suite of rooms at the Imperial Palace. Several tutors were provided her, in all the fields deemed seemly for a queenly education. During this time she became deeply interested in the magical arts, but she found the study of history and politics not at all to her prefer\u00ADence.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn occasion she met with Tiber Septim in the Palace gardens and he would unfailingly and politely inquire as to her progress -- and chide her, although with a smile, for her disinterest at matters of state. However, he was always happy to instruct her on the finer points of magic, and he could make even history and politics seem interesting. \u0022They\u0027re people, child, not dry facts in a dusty volume,\u0022 he said.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs her understanding broadened, their discussions grew longer, deeper, more frequent. He spoke to her of his vision of a united \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Tamriel\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Tamriel\u0022\u003ETamriel\u003C/a\u003E, each race separate and distinct but with shared ideals and goals, all contrib\u00ADuting to the common weal. \u0022Some things are universal, shared by all sentient folk of good will,\u0022 he said. \u0022So the One teaches us. We must unite against the malicious and the brutish, the miscreated -- the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Orc\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Orc\u0022\u003EOrc\u003C/a\u003Es, \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Troll\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Troll\u0022\u003Etroll\u003C/a\u003Es, \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Goblin\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Goblin\u0022\u003Egoblin\u003C/a\u003Es, and other worse creatures -- and not strive against one another.\u0022 His blue eyes would light up as he stared into his dream, and Barenziah was delighted just to sit and listen to him. If he drew close to her, the side of her body next to him would glow as if he were a smoldering blaze. If their hands met she would tingle all over as if his body were charged with a \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Shock_Damage\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Shock Damage\u0022\u003Eshock spell\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne day, quite unexpectedly, he took her face in his hands and kissed her gently on the mouth. She drew back after a few moments, astonished by the violence of her feelings, and he apologized instantly. \u0022I... we... we didn\u0027t mean to do that. It\u0027s just -- you are so beautiful, dear. So very beautiful.\u0022 He was looking at her with hopeless yearning in his generous eyes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EShe turned away, tears streaming down her face.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Are you angry with us? Speak to us. Please.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBarenziah shook her head. \u0022I could never be angry with you, Excellency. I... I love you. I know it\u0027s wrong, but I can\u0027t help it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We have a consort,\u0022 he said. \u0022She is a good and virtuous woman, the mother of our children and future heirs. We could never put her aside -- yet there is nothing between us and her, no sharing of the spirit. She would have us be other than what we are. We are the most powerful person in all of Tamriel, and... Barenziah, we... I... I think I am the most lonely as well.\u0022 He stood up suddenly. \u0022Power!\u0022 he said with sublime contempt. \u0022I\u0027d trade a goodly share of it for youth and love if the gods would only sanction it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But you are strong and vigorous and vital, more than any man I\u0027ve ever known.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe shook his head vehemently. \u0022Today, perhaps. Yet I am less than I was yesterday, last year, ten years ago. I feel the sting of my mortality, and it is painful.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022If I can ease your pain, let me.\u0022 Barenziah moved toward him, hands outstretched.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No. I would not take your innocence from you.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m not that innocent.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022How so?\u0022 The Emperor\u0027s voice suddenly grated harshly, his brows knitted.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBarenziah\u0027s mouth went dry. What had she just said? But she couldn\u0027t turn back know. He would know. \u0022There was Straw,\u0022 she faltered. \u0022I... I was lonely too. Am lonely. And not so strong as you.\u0022 She cast her eyes down in abashment. \u0022I... I guess I\u0027m not worthy, Excellency--\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No, no. Not so. Barenziah. My Barenziah. It cannot last for long. You have a duty toward Mourn\u00ADhold, and a duty toward the Empire. I must tend toward mine as well. But while we may -- shall we share what we have, what we can, and pray the One forgives us our frailty?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETiber Septim held out his arms -- and wordlessly, willingly, Barenziah stepped into his embrace.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ccenter\u003E***\u003C/center\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You caper on the edge of a volcano, child,\u0022 Drelliane admonished as Barenziah admired the splendid star sapphire ring her imperial lover had given her to celebrate their one-month anniversary.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022How so? We make one another happy. We harm no one. Symmachus bade me be discriminating and discreet. Who better could I choose? And we\u0027ve been most discreet. He treats me like a daughter in public.\u0022 Tiber Septim\u0027s nightly visits were made through a secret passage that only few in the Palace were privy to -- himself and a handful of trusted bodyguards.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022He slavers over you like a cur his supper. Have you not noticed the coolness of the Empress and her son toward you?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBarenziah shrugged. Even before she and Septim had become lovers, she\u0027d received no more from his family than bare civility. Threadbare civility. \u0022What matter? It is Tiber who holds the power.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But it is his son who holds the future. Do not put his mother up to public scorn, I beg you.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Can I help it if that dry stick of a woman cannot hold her husband\u0027s interest even in conversation at dinner?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Have less to say in public. That is all I ask. She matters little, it is true -- but her children love her, and you do not want them as enemies. Tiber Septim has not long to live. I mean,\u0022 Drelliane amended quickly at Barenziah\u0027s scowl, \u0022humans are all short-lived.

Ah, but how can I make you see truly, you who are so young and human-bred as well!

We are as a year to their hour, a decade to their day.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBarenziah just laughed. She knew that rumors abounded about her and Tiber Septim. She enjoyed the attention, for all save the Empress and her son seemed captivated by her. Minstrels sang of her dark beauty and her charming ways. She was in fashion, and in love -- and if it was temporary, well, what was not? She was happy for the first time she could remember, each of her days filled with joy and pleasure. And the nights were even better.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ccenter\u003E***\u003C/center\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What is wrong with me?\u0022 Barenziah lamented. \u0022Look, not one of my skirts fit.

Am I getting fat?\u0022 Barenziah regarded her thin arms and legs and her undeniably thickened waist in the mirror with displeasure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDrelliane shrugged. \u0022You appear to be with child, young as you are. Constant pairing with a human has brought you to early fertility. I see no choice but for you to speak with the Emperor about it. You are in his power. It would be best, I think, for you to go directly to Mournhold if he would agree to it, and bear the child there.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Alone?\u0022 Barenziah placed her hands on her swollen belly, tears forming in her eyes. Everything in her yearned to share the fruit of her love with her lover. \u0022He\u0027ll never agree to that. He won\u0027t be parted from me now. You\u0027ll see.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDrelliane shook her head. Although she said no more, a look of sympathy and sorrow had replaced her usual cool scorn.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat night Barenziah told Tiber Septim when he came to her for their usual assignation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022With child?\u0022 He looked shocked. No, stunned. \u0022You\u0027re sure of it? But I was told Elves do not bear at so young an age...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBarenziah forced a smile. \u0022How can I be sure?

But it was also rich with the sweet spicy smell of the late-blooming black rose, which was native to Morrowind and grew in every shadowy nook and crevice of its highlands, finding nourishment even in the stoniest banks and ridges.

He was his old commanding self -- but she sensed something else as well. He was eager for her approval of the arrangements, was in fact fishing for it. That was new. He had never required her commendation before.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe asked her nothing about her stay in the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Imperial_City\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Imperial City\u0022\u003EImperial City\u003C/a\u003E, or of her affair with Tiber Septim -- although Barenziah was certain Drelliane had told him, or earlier written him, everything in detail.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ceremony itself, like so much else, was a mixture of old and new -- parts of it from the ancient Dark Elven tradition of Mournhold, the others dictated by Imperial decree.

She accepted oaths of fealty and allegiance from the people, the nobility, and the council. This last was composed of a blend of Imperial emissaries (\u0022advisors\u0022 they were called) and native representatives of the Mournhold people, who were mostly elders in accordance with Elven custom.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBarenziah later found that much of her time was occupied in attempting to reconcile these two factions and their cronies. The elders were expected to do most of the conciliating, in light of reforms introduced by the Empire pertaining to land ownership and surface farming. But most of these went clean against Dark Elven observances. Tiber Septim, \u0022in the name of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:The_One\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:The One\u0022\u003Ethe One\u003C/a\u003E,\u0022 had ordained a new tradition -- and apparently even the gods and goddesses themselves were expected to obey.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe new Queen threw herself into her work and her studies. She was through with love and men for a long, long time -- if not forever. There were other pleasures, she discovered, as Symmachus had promised her long ago: those of the mind, and those of power. She developed (surprisingly, for she had always rebelled against her tutors at the Imperial City) a deep love for Dark Elven history and mythology, a hunger to know more fully the people from whom she had sprung. She was gratified to learn that they had been proud warriors and skilled craftsmen and cunning mages since time immemorial.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETiber Septim lived for another half-century, during which she saw him on several occasions as she was bidden to the Imperial City on one reason of state or another. He greeted her with warmth during these vis\u00ADits, and they even had long talks together about events in the Empire when opportunity would permit. He seemed to have quite forgotten that there had ever been anything between them more than easy friendship and a profound political alliance. He changed little as the years passed. Rumor had it that his mages had developed spells to extend his vitality, and that even the One had granted him immortality. Then one day a messenger came with the news that Tiber Septim was dead, and his grandson \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Pelagius_Septim\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect mw-disambig\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Pelagius Septim\u0022\u003EPelagius\u003C/a\u003E was now Emperor in his place.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey had heard the news in private, she and Symmachus.

She couldn\u0027t remember his ever touching her before. She\u0027d never thought of him in that way -- and yet, undeniably, an old familiar warmth spread through her. She\u0027d forgot\u00ADten how good it felt, that warmth. Not the scorching heat she\u0027d felt with Tiber Septim, but the comforting, robust ardor she somehow associated with... with Straw! Straw. Poor Straw. She hadn\u0027t thought of him in so long. He\u0027d be middle-aged now if he were still alive. Probably with a dozen children, she thought affectionately... and a hearty wife who hopefully could talk for two.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Marry me, Barenziah,\u0022 Symmachus was saying, he seemed to have picked up her thoughts on mar\u00ADriage, children... wives, \u0022I\u0027ve worked and toiled and waited long enough, haven\u0027t I?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMarriage. A peasant with peasant dreams. The thought appeared in her mind, clear and unbidden. Hadn\u0027t she used those very same words to describe Straw, so very long ago? And yet, why not? If not Symmachus, who else?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMany of the great noble families of Morrowind had been wiped out in Tiber Septim\u0027s great war of unification, before the treaty. Dark Elven rule had been restored, it was true -- but not the old, not the true nobility. Most of them were upstarts like Symmachus, and not even half as good or deserving as he was. He had fought to keep Mournhold whole and hale when their so-called counselors would have picked at its bones, sucked them dry as \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Ebonheart\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Ebonheart\u0022\u003EEbonheart\u003C/a\u003E had been sucked dry. He\u0027d fought for Mournhold, fought for her, while she and the kingdom grew and thrived. She felt a sudden rush of gratitude -- and, undeniably, affection. He was steady and reliable. And he\u0027d served her well. And loved her well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Why not?\u0022 she said, smiling. And took his hand.

Mournhold prospered steadily. Her people were secure and fed, her mines and farms productive. All was well -- save that the royal marriage had pro\u00ADduced no children. No heirs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EElven children are slow to come, and most demanding of their welcome -- and noble children more so than others.

If that\u0027s the case, then you\u0027re not safe here either. Come with us,\u0022 she urged.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe took her hands in his. \u0022Barenziah. My love. Heart of my heart.

I need you. We can do without the rest of it if we have each other. Empty hands and empty bellies are easier to bear than an empty heart.\u0022 She started to cry, thinking of the Nightingale and that sordid business with the Staff. \u0022My foolishness has brought us to this pass.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe smiled at her tenderly. \u0022If so, \u0027tis not so bad a place to be.\u0022 His eyes rested indulgently on their children. \u0022None of us shall ever go without, or want for anything. Ever. Ever, my love, I promise you. I cost you everything once, Barenziah, I and Tiber Septim. Ai. Without my aid the Empire would never have begun. I helped its rise.\u0022 His voice hardened. \u0022I can bring about its fall. You may tell Uriel Septim that. That, and that my patience is not infinite.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBarenziah gasped. Symmachus was not given to empty threats. She\u0027d no more imagined that he would ever turn against the Empire than that the old house \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Wolf\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Wolf\u0022\u003Ewolf\u003C/a\u003E lying by the grate would turn on her. \u0022How?\u0022 she demanded breathlessly.

My Queen ... my Barenziah.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBarenziah held him, held him as tight as she could. But in spite of the warmth in his embrace, she couldn\u0027t help shivering.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ccenter\u003E***\u003C/center\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBarenziah stood before the Emperor\u0027s throne, trying to explain Mournhold\u0027s straits. She\u0027d waited weeks for an audience with Uriel Septim, having been fobbed off on this pretext or that. \u0022His Majesty is indisposed.\u0022 \u0022An urgent matter demands His Excellency\u0027s attention.\u0022 \u0022I am sorry, Your Highness, there must be some mistake. Your appointment is for next week. No, see...\u0022 And now it wasn\u0027t even going well. The Emperor did not even make the slightest pretence at listening to her. He hadn\u0027t invited her to sit, nor had he dismissed the children. Helseth stood still as a carven image, but little Morgiah had begun to fuss.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe state of her own mind didn\u0027t help her any. Shortly upon arrival at her lodgings, the Mournholdian ambassador to the Imperial City had demanded entry, bringing with him a sheaf of dispatches from Symmachus. Bad news, and plenty of it. The \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Arnesian_War\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Arnesian War\u0022\u003Erevolt\u003C/a\u003E had finally begun. The peasants had organized around a few disgruntled members of Mournhold\u0027s minor nobility, and were demanding Symmachus step down and hand over the reins of government. Only the Imperial Guard and a handful of troops whose families had been retainers of Barenziah\u0027s house for generations stood between Symmachus and the rabble. Hostilities had already broken out, but apparently Symmachus was safe and still in control. Not for long, he wrote. He entreated Barenziah to try her best with the Emperor -- but in any case she was to stay in the Imperial City until he wrote to tell her it was safe to go back home with the children.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EShe had tried to barge her way through the Imperial bureaucracy -- with little success. And to add to her growing panic, all news from Mournhold had come to a sudden stop. Tottering between rage at the Emperor\u0027s numerous major-domos and fear of the fate awaiting her and her family, the weeks had passed by tensely, agonizingly, remorselessly. Then one day the Mournholdian ambassador came calling to tell her she should expect news from Symmachus the following night at the latest, not through the regular channels but by nighthawk. Seemingly by the same stroke of luck, she was informed that same day by a clerk from the Imperial Court that Uriel Septim had finally consented to grant her an audience early on the morrow.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Emperor had greeted the three of them when they came into the audience chamber with a too-bright smile of welcome that nonetheless didn\u0027t reach his eyes. Then, as she presented her children, he had gazed at them with a fixed attention that was real yet somehow inappropriate. Barenziah had been dealing with humans for nearly five hundred years now, and had developed the skill of reading their expressions and movements that was far beyond what any human could ever perceive. Try as the Emperor might to conceal it, there was hunger in his eyes -- and something else. Regret? Yes. Regret. But why? He had several fine children of his own. Why covet hers? And why look at her with such a vicious -- however brief -- yearning? Perhaps he had tired of his consort. Humans were notoriously, though predictably, inconstant. After that one long, burning glance, his gaze had shifted away as she began to speak of her mission and the violence that had erupted in Mournhold. He sat still as stone throughout her entire account.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPuzzled at his inertia, and \u003Cspan title=\u0022Please do NOT CHANGE to \u0026quot;vexed to\u0026quot;: the original source is intentionally copied and has the error.\u0022 style=\u0022border-bottom:1px dotted\u0022\u003Evexed\u0026#160;\u003Ci\u003E\u003Csmall\u003E[\u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/UESPWiki:Spelling#Quotes\u0022 title=\u0022UESPWiki:Spelling\u0022\u003Esic\u003C/a\u003E]\u003C/small\u003E\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E no end, Barenziah stared into the pale, set face, looking for some trace of the Septims she\u0027d known in the past. She didn\u0027t know Uriel Septim well, having met him once when he was still a child, and then again at his coronation twenty years later. Twice, that was all. He\u0027d been a stern and dignified presence at the ceremony, even as a young adult -- yet not icily remote as this more mature man was. In fact, despite the physical resemblance, he didn\u0027t seem to be the same man at all. Not the same, yet something about him was familiar to her, more familiar than it should be, some trick of posture or gesture...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly she felt very hot, as if lava had been poured over her. \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Illusion\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Illusion\u0022\u003EIllusion\u003C/a\u003E! She had studied the arts of illusion well since the Nightingale had deceived her so badly. She had learned to detect it -- and she felt it now, as certainly as a blind man could feel the sun on his face. Illusion! But why? Her mind worked furiously even as her mouth went on reciting details about Mournhold\u0027s troubles. Vanity?

And then he was sitting before her. Then the vision changed, and it was Uriel Septim. He looked sad. Trapped. And then the vision faded once more, and another man sat in his place, like the Nightingale, and yet unlike. Pale skin, bloodshot eyes, Elven ears -- and about him a fierce glow of concentrated malice, an aura of eldritch energy -- a horrible, destructive shimmer. This man was capable of anything!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then once again she was looking into the face of Uriel Septim.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHow could she be sure she wasn\u0027t imagining things? Perhaps her mind was playing tricks on her. She felt a sudden vast weariness, as if she\u0027d been carrying a heavy burden too long and too far. She decided to abandon her earnest narrative of Mournhold\u0027s ills -- as it was quite plainly getting her nowhere -- and switch back to pleasantry. Pleasantry, however, with a hidden agenda.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Do you remember, Sire, Symmachus and I had dinner with your family shortly after your father\u0027s coronation?

Very cautiously. \u0022I do believe I recall that.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You and Justin were such friends, Your Majesty. I was told he died not long after.

I still do not like to speak of him.\u0022 His eyes turned blank -- or blanker, if it had been possible. \u0022As for your request, Milady, we shall take it under advisement and let you know.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBarenziah bowed, as did the children. A nod from the Emperor dismissed them, and they backed away from the imperial presence.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EShe took a deep breath when they emerged from the throne room. \u0022Justin\u0022 had been an imaginary playmate, although young Uriel had insisted a place be set for Justin at every meal. Not only that, Justin, despite the boyish name, had been a girl! Symmachus had kept up the joke long after she had gone the way of imaginary childhood friends -- inquiring after Justin\u0027s health whenever he and Uriel Septim met, and being responded to in as mock-serious a fashion. The last Barenziah had heard of Justin, several years ago, the Emperor had evidently joked elaborately to Symmachus that she had met an adventurous though incorrigible \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Khajiit\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Khajiit\u0022\u003EKhajiit\u003C/a\u003E youth, married him, and settled down in \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Lilandril\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Lilandril\u0022\u003ELilandril\u003C/a\u003E to raise \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Fire_Fern\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Fire Fern\u0022\u003Efire ferns\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Mugwort\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Mugwort\u0022\u003Emugwort\u003C/a\u003Es.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe man sitting on the Emperor\u0027s divan was not Uriel Septim! The Nightingale? Could it be...? Yes. Yes! A chord of recognition rang through her and Barenziah knew she was right. It was him. It was! The Nightingale! Masquerading as the Emperor! Symmachus had been wrong, so wrong...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat now? she wondered frantically. What had become of Uriel Septim -- and more to the point, what did it mean for her and Symmachus, and all of Mournhold? Thinking back, Barenziah guessed that their troubles were due to this false Emperor, this Nightingale-spawned glamour -- or whatever he really was. He must have taken Uriel Septim\u0027s place shortly before the unreasonable demands on Mournhold had begun. That would explain why relations had deteriorated for so long (as humans reckoned time), long after her disapproved liaison with Tiber Septim. The Nightingale knew of Symmachus\u0027 famed loyalty to, and knowledge of, the Septim House, and was effecting a pre-emptive strike. If that were the case, they were all in terrible danger. She and the children were in his power here in the Imperial City, and Symmachus was left alone to deal with troubles of the Nightingale\u0027s brewing in Mournhold.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat must she do? Barenziah impelled the children ahead of her, a hand on each shoulder, trying to stay cool, collected, her ladies-in-waiting and personal knights escort trailing behind. Finally they reached their waiting carriage. Even though their suite of rooms was only a few blocks from the Palace, royal dignity forbade travel on foot for even short distances -- and for once, Barenziah was glad of it. The carriage seemed a kind of refuge now, false as she knew the feeling must be.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA boy dashed up to one of the guards and handed him a scroll, then pointed toward the carriage. The guard brought it to her. The boy waited, eyes wide and shining.

She wanted only to leave this city! Certainly she had no inclination toward any dalliance with a dazzled human. She looked up, frowning, and one of the guards said, \u0022Milady, the boy says his master awaits your reply yonder.\u0022 She looked in the direction indicated and saw a handsome elderly man on horseback, surrounded by a half dozen courtiers and cavaliers. He caught her eye and bowed respectfully, taking off a plumed hat.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Very well,\u0022 Barenziah said to the boy on impulse. \u0022Tell your master he may call on me tonight, after the dinner hour.\u0022 King Eadwyre looked polite and grave, and rather worried -- but not in the least lovestruck.

But go on, please. Of what assistance might I be, Milord King?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EQuickly the monarch outlined a plot. The mage \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Ria_Silmane\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Ria Silmane\u0022\u003ERia Silmane\u003C/a\u003E, of late apprenticed to the vile Jagar Tharn, had been killed and declared a traitor by the false Emperor. Yet she had retained a bit of her powers and could still contact a few of those she had known well on the mortal plane. She had chosen a \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Eternal_Champion\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Eternal Champion\u0022\u003EChampion\u003C/a\u003E who would undertake to find the Staff of Chaos, which had been hidden by the traitorous sorcerer in an unknown site. This Champion was to wield the Staff\u0027s power to destroy Jagar Tharn, who was otherwise invulnerable, and rescue the true Emperor being held prisoner in another dimension. However, the Champion, while thankfully still alive, now languished in the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Imperial_Dungeons\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Imperial Dungeons\u0022\u003EImperial Dungeons\u003C/a\u003E. Tharn\u0027s attention must be diverted while the chosen one gained freedom with Ria\u0027s spirit\u0027s help. Barenziah had the false Emperor\u0027s ears -- and seemingly his eyes. Would she provide the necessary distraction?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I suppose I could obtain another audience with him,\u0022 Barenziah said carefully. \u0022But would that be sufficient? I must tell you that my children and I have just recently been declared traitors to the Empire.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022In Mournhold, perhaps, Milady, and Morrowind. Things are different in the Imperial City and the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Cyrodiil\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Cyrodiil\u0022\u003EImperial Province\u003C/a\u003E. The same administrative morass that makes it near impossible to obtain an audience with the Emperor and his ministers also quite assures that you would never be unlawfully imprisoned or otherwise punished without benefit of due legal process. In your case, Milady, and your children\u0027s, the situation is further exacerbated by your royal rank. As Queen and heirs apparent, your persons are considered inviolable -- sacrosanct, in fact.\u0022 The King grinned. \u0022The Imperial bureaucracy, Milady, is a double-edged claymore.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo. At least she and the children were safe for the time being. Then a thought struck her. \u0022Milord King, what did you mean earlier when you said I had the false Emperor\u0027s eyes? And seemingly, at that?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEadwyre looked uncomfortable. \u0022It was whispered among the servants that Jagar Tharn kept your likeness in a sort of shrine in his chambers.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I see.\u0022 Her thoughts wandered momentarily to that insane romance of hers with the Nightingale. She had been madly in love with him. Foolish woman. And the man she had once loved had caused to be killed the man she truly did love. Did love. Loved. He\u0027s gone now, he\u0027s... he... She still couldn\u0027t bring herself to accept the fact that Symmachus was dead. But even if he is, she told herself firmly, my love is alive, and remains. He would always be with her. As would the pain. The pain of living the rest of her life without him. The pain of trying to survive each day, each night, without his presence, his comfort, his love. The pain of knowing he would never see his children grow into a fine pair of adults, who would never know their father, how brave he was, how strong, how wonderful, how loving... especially little Morgiah.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd for that, for all that, for all you have done to my family, Nightingale -- you must die.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Does that surprise you?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEadwyre\u0027s words broke into her thoughts. \u0022What?

He turned once again to their plans. \u0022Our chosen one may need a few days to escape, Milady.

Under the circumstances I must do what I may to avenge myself upon the murderer of my children\u0027s father.\u0022 A single tear escaped the fortress of her eyes.

He nodded a greeting and waved his hand toward the window. \u0022Magnificent view, isn\u0027t it?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBarenziah stared out over the towers of the great city. It dawned on her that this was the very chamber where she\u0027d first met Tiber Septim all those years ago. Centuries ago. Tiber Septim. Another man she had loved. Who else had she loved? Symmachus, Tiber Septim... and Straw. She remembered the big blond stable-boy with sudden and intense affection. She never realized it till now, but she had loved Straw. Only she had never let him know. She had been so young then, those had been carefree days, halcyon days... before everything, before all this... before... him. Not Symmachus. The Nightingale. She was shocked in spite of herself. The man could still affect her. Even now. Even after all that had happened. A strong wave of inchoate emotion swept over her.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen she turned back at last, Uriel Septim had vanished -- and the Nightingale sat in his place.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You knew,\u0022 he said quietly, scanning her face. \u0022You knew.

I don\u0027t want that at all, Barenziah.\u0022 He came near, speaking low in the old caressing voice that had sent shivers cascading through her body. The same voice that was doing the same thing to her, here and now. \u0022Don\u0027t you see? This was the only way.\u0022 His hands closed on her arms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EShe felt her resolve fading, her disgust at him weakening. \u0022You could have taken me with you.\u0022 Unbidden tears gathered in her eyes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe shook his head. \u0022I didn\u0027t have the power. Ah, but now, now...! I have it all. Mine to have, mine to share, mine to give -- to you.\u0022 He once more waved his hand toward the window and the city beyond. \u0022All Tamriel is mine to lay at your feet -- and that is only the beginning.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s too late.

It shall be yours.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHer whole life flashed in front of her. The past, the present, and the future still to come.

That I can, and will, show you.\u0022 Their bodies merged, limbs tangled together.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELater, when they had drawn a bit apart and he lay dozing, she thought sleepily, \u0022One of two, two of one, three of two, two of three... what cannot be destroyed or banished might be split apart, perhaps...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EShe stood up, eyes blazing.

He scribbled entries onto it every night after quick reports from underlings. It was locked in a bureau. But the lock was a simple one. She had, after all, been a member of the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Thieves_Guild_(faction)\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Thieves Guild (faction)\u0022\u003EThieves Guild\u003C/a\u003E in a past life... in another life... another Barenziah...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne morning Barenziah managed to sneak a quick look at it while he was occupied at his toilet. She discovered that the first piece of the Staff of Chaos was hidden in an ancient \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Dwemer\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Dwemer\u0022\u003EDwarvish\u003C/a\u003E mine called \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Fang_Lair\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Fang Lair\u0022\u003EFang Lair\u003C/a\u003E -- although its location was given only in the vaguest of terms.

One could glimpse it now and then, when his eyes would go blank and hard. And yet, though he had a different concept of it, he yearned for happiness too, and contentment. Peasant dreams, Barenziah thought, and Straw flashed before her eyes again, looking lost and sad. And then Therris, with a feline Khajiit smile. Tiber Septim, powerful and lonely. Symmachus, solid, stolid Symmachus, who did what ought to be done, quietly and efficiently. The Nightingale. The Nightingale, a riddle and a certainty, both the darkness and the light. The Nightingale, who would rule all, and more -- and spread chaos in the name of order.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBarenziah got reluctant leave from him to visit her children, who had yet to be told of their father\u0027s death -- and of the Emperor\u0027s offer of protection. She finally did, and it wasn\u0027t easy. Morgiah clung to her for what seemed an era, sobbing wretchedly, while Helseth ran off into the garden to be alone, afterward refusing all her attempts to speak to him on the subject of his father, or even to let her hold him to her breast.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEadwyre called on her while she was there. She told him what she had discovered so far, explaining that she must remain awhile yet and learn more as she could.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Nightingale teased her about her elderly admirer. He was quite aware of Eadwyre\u0027s suspicion -- but he wasn\u0027t the least bit perturbed, for no one took the old fool seriously. Barenziah even managed to arrange a reconciliation of sorts between them. Eadwyre publicly recanted his misgivings, and his \u0022old friend\u0022 the Emperor forgave him. He was afterward invited to dine with them at least once a week.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe children liked Eadwyre, even Helseth, who disapproved of his mother\u0027s liaison with the Emperor and consequently detested him. He had become surly and temperamental as the days passed, and frequently quarreled with both his mother and her lover. Eadwyre was not happy with the affair either, and the Nightingale took great delight at times in openly displaying his affection for Barenziah just to nettle the old man.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey could not marry, of course, for Uriel Septim was already married. At least, not yet. The Nightingale had exiled the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Caula_Voria\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Caula Voria\u0022\u003EEmpress\u003C/a\u003E shortly after taking the Emperor\u0027s place, but had not dared harm her.

It had been given out that she was suffering from ill health, and rumors had been circulated by the Nightingale\u0027s agents that she had mental problems. The Emperor\u0027s children had likewise been dispatched to various prisons all across Tamriel disguised as \u0022schools.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022She\u0027ll grow worse in time,\u0022 Nightingale said carelessly, referring to the Empress and eyeing Barenziah\u0027s swollen breasts and swelling belly with satisfaction. \u0022As for their children... Well, life is full of hazards, isn\u0027t it? We\u0027ll be married. Your child will be my true heir.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe did want the child. Barenziah was sure of that. She was far less sure, however, of his feelings for her. They argued continually now, often violently, usually about Helseth, whom he wanted to send away to school in \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Summerset_Isle\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Summerset Isle\u0022\u003ESummurset Isle\u003C/a\u003E, the province farthest from the Imperial City. Barenziah made no effort to avoid these altercations.

Nor could he openly declare war on Wayrest. He had no legitimate claim on her or her unborn child.

She in her turn did not love him -- but she was fond of him, and that was something.

She had nothing left, nothing but pain, and memories... and her children. She only wanted to raise her family, and provide them a good life, and be left to live out what remained of hers. She had no doubt it was going to be a long life yet. And during it she wanted peace, and quiet, and serenity, of her soul as well as of her heart. Peasant dreams. That was what she wanted.

The sentry\u0027s blade glided against the armor and knocked to the left, throwing the young man off balance.

It was on one such jaunt on a sunny Fredas in \u003Ca href=\u0022/w/index.php?title=Skyrim:Mid_Year\u0026amp;action=edit\u0026amp;redlink=1\u0022 class=\u0022new\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Mid Year (page does not exist)\u0022\u003EMid Year\u003C/a\u003E that I made a discovery that changed my heart and my life.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere were several old abandoned houses down the street from my own home, and I often played around them, imagining them to be filled with desperate outlaws or haunted by hundreds of evil spirits. I never had the nerve to go inside. In fact, had I not that day seen some other children who had delighted in teasing me in the past, I would never have gone in. But I needed a sanctuary, so I ran into the closest one.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe house seemed to be as desolate on the inside as on the outside, further proof that no one lived there, and had not for some time. When I heard footsteps, I could only assume that the loathsome little urchins I hoped to avoid had followed me in. I escaped to the basement, and from there, past a broken-down wall that led to a well. I could still hear the footsteps above, and I decided that I was still loath to confront my tormentors. Knocking aside the rusty locks on the well, I slipped down below.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe well was dry, but I discovered it was far from empty. There was a sort of a sub-basement to the house, three large rooms that were clean, furnished, and evidently not abandoned at all. My senses told me someone was living in the house, after all: not only my sense of sight, but my sense of smell. For one of the rooms was a large red-painted kitchen, and spread out on the coals of the oven was a roast, carved into small morsels. Passing a beautiful and appropriate bas-relief of a mother carving a roast for her grateful children, I beheld the kitchen and the wonders within.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELike I said, food had never interested me before, but I was transfixed, and even now as I write this, words fail me in describing the rich aroma that hung in the air. It was like nothing I had ever smelled in my family\u0027s kitchen, and I was unable to stop myself from popping one of the steaming chunks of meat into my mouth. The taste was magical, the flesh tender and sweet. Before I knew it, I had eaten everything on the stove, and I learned at that very second the truth that that food can and should be sublime.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter gorging myself and having my culinary epiphany, I was conflicted on what to do. Part of me wanted to wait down in that red kitchen until the chef returned, so I could ask him what his secret recipe was for the delicious meat. Part of me recognized that I had stolen into someone\u0027s house and eaten their dinner, and it would be wise to leave while I could. That was what I did.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETime and again, I\u0027ve tried to return to that strange, wonderful place, but Cheydinhal has changed over time. Old houses have been reclaimed, and new houses abandoned. I know what to look for on the inside of the house - the well, the beautiful etching of a woman preparing to carve out a roast for her children, the red kitchen itself - but I have never been able to find the house again. After a while, as I grew older, I stopped trying. It is better as it remains in my memory, the most perfect meal I ever ate.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe inspiration for my life that followed all was cooked up, together with that fabulous meat, right there in the Red Kitchen.\u003C/p\u003E\n","Author":"Simocles Quo","Description":"Autobiographical musings of how the Master of Cuisine came to adore viands","Type":"Sneak skill book","CoverImage":"SR-icon-book-BasicBook6a.png"},{"Id":"xx03B063","Title":"The Red Year, Vol. I","Text":"\n\u003Ch4\u003E\u003Cspan class=\u0022mw-headline\u0022 id=\u0022Foreword\u0022\u003EForeword\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/h4\u003E\n\u003Cdl\u003E\n\u003Cdd\u003E\u003Ci\u003EWhen I originally decided to write this accounting of the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Red_Year\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Red Year\u0022\u003ERed Year\u003C/a\u003E, I elected to travel across \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Morrowind\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Morrowind\u0022\u003EMorrowind\u003C/a\u003E and speak to the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Dunmer\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Dunmer\u0022\u003EDunmer\u003C/a\u003E people themselves.

All around me, people were desperately trying to save their livestock and their families from the rising water. Just when the ground shaking finally died down, and I had a moment to think, there was a horrible cracking noise. I\u0027ll never forget it, because I knew what it was before I looked. The entire southern wall of Tear collapsed sending guards tumbling into the swamp. I heard people screaming as they were covered by the rubble and forced down into the water. Forgetting my own problems, I looked over at my fellow farmers who were all staring at the carnage unfolding before us. Suddenly, we all just forgot our own problems and ran to help.

Perhaps most crucially, the Navy had only enough heavy transport capacity to move four legions at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt should be noted here that the Commission does not find fault with the Emperor\u0027s preparations for the invasion. Based on the information available prior to the invasion, (which, while obviously deficient in hindsight, great effort had been made to accumulate), the Commission believes that the Emperor did not act recklessly or imprudently. Some have argued that the Expeditionary Force was too small. The Commission believes that on the contrary, even if shipping could have been found to transport and supply more legions (an impossibility without crippling the trade of the entire Empire), this would have merely added to the scale of the disaster; it would not have averted it. Neither could the rest of the Empire be denuded of legions; the memory of the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Camoran_Usurper\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Camoran Usurper\u0022\u003ECamoran Usurper\u003C/a\u003E was still fresh, and the Emperor believed (and this Commission agrees) that the security of the Empire precluded a larger concentration of military force outside of Tamriel. If anything, the Commission believes that the Expeditionary Force was too large. Despite the creation of two new legions during his reign (and the recreation of the Fifth), the loss of the Expeditionary Force left the Empire in a dangerously weak position relative to the provinces, as the current situation makes all too clear. This suggests that the invasion of Akavir was beyond the Empire\u0027s current strength; even if the Emperor could have fielded and maintained a larger force in Akavir, the Empire may have disintegrated behind him.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch5\u003E\u003Cspan class=\u0022mw-headline\u0022 id=\u0022Part_II:_The_Invasion_of_Akavir\u0022\u003EPart II: The Invasion of Akavir\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/h5\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Expeditionary Force left Black Harbor on 23rd Rain\u0027s Hand, \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Third_Era#3E_288\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Third Era\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022white-space:nowrap\u0022\u003E288\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E, and with fair weather landed in Akavir after six weeks at sea. The landing site was a small Tsaesci port at the mouth of a large river, chosen for its proximity to Tamriel as well as its location in a fertile river valley, giving easy access to the interior as well as good foraging for the army. All went well at first. The Tsaesci had abandoned the town when the Expeditionary Force approached, so they took possession of it and renamed it \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Septimia\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Septimia\u0022\u003ESeptimia\u003C/a\u003E, the first colony of the new \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Imperial_Province_of_Akavir\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Imperial Province of Akavir\u0022\u003EImperial Province of Akavir\u003C/a\u003E. While the engineers fortified the town and expanded the port facilities to serve the Far East Fleet, the Emperor marched inland with two legions. The surrounding land was reported to be rich, well-watered fields, and meeting no resistance the army took the next city upriver, also abandoned. This was refounded as \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Ionith\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Ionith\u0022\u003EIonith\u003C/a\u003E, and the Emperor established his headquarters there, being much larger than Septimia and better-located to dominate the surrounding countryside.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Expeditionary Force had yet to meet any real resistance, although the legions were constantly shadowed by mounted enemy patrols which prevented any but large scouting parties from leaving the main body of the army. One thing the Emperor sorely lacked was cavalry, due to the limited space on the transport fleet, although for the time being the battlemages made up for this with magical reconnaissance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Emperor now sent out envoys to try to contact the Tsaesci king or whoever ruled this land, but his messengers never returned. In retrospect, the Commission believes that valuable time was wasted in this effort while the army was stalled at Ionith, which could have been better spent in advancing quickly while the enemy was still, apparently, surprised by the invasion. However, the Emperor believed at the time that the Tsaesci could be overawed by the Empire\u0027s power and he might win a province by negotiation with no need for serious fighting.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, the four legions were busy building a road between Septimia and Ionith, setting up fortified guard posts along the river, and fortifying both cities\u0027 defences, activities which would serve them well later. Due to their lack of cavalry, scouting was limited, and communication between the two cities constantly threatened by enemy raiders, with which the legions were still unable to come to grips.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe original plan had been to bring the two reinforcing legions across as soon as the initial landing had secured a port, but the fateful decision was now taken to delay their arrival and instead begin using the Fleet to transport colonists. The Emperor and the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Elder_Council\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Elder Council\u0022\u003ECouncil\u003C/a\u003E agreed that, due to the complete abandonment of the conquered area by its native population, colonists were needed to work the fields so that the Expeditionary Force would not have to rely entirely on the fleet for supplies. In addition, unrest had broken out in \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Yneslea\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Yneslea\u0022\u003EYneslea\u003C/a\u003E, athwart the supply route to Akavir, and the Council believed the Ninth and Seventeenth legions would be better used in repacifying those territories and securing the Expeditionary Force\u0027s supply lines.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe civilian colonists and their supplies began arriving in Septimia in mid-Hearthfire, and they took over the preparation of the fields (which had been started by the legionnaires) for a spring crop. A number of cavalry mounts were also brought over at this time, and the raids on the two Imperial colonies subsequently fell off. Tsaesci emissaries also finally arrived in Ionith, purportedly to begin peace negotiations, and the Expeditionary Force settled in for what was expected to be a quiet winter.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt this time, the Council urged the Emperor to return to Tamriel with the Fleet, to deal with many pressing matters of the Empire while the army was in winter quarters, but the Emperor decided that it would be best to remain in Akavir. This turned out to be fortunate, because a large portion of the Fleet, including the Emperor\u0027s flagship, was destroyed by an early winter storm during the homeward voyage. The winter storm season of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Third_Era#3E_288\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Third Era\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022white-space:nowrap\u0022\u003E288\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E-\u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Third_Era#3E_289\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Third Era\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022white-space:nowrap\u0022\u003E289\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E was unusually prolonged and exceptionally severe, and prevented the Fleet from returning to Akavir as planned with additional supplies. This was reported to the Emperor via battlemage and it was agreed that the Expeditionary Force could survive on what supplies it had on hand until the spring.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch5\u003E\u003Cspan class=\u0022mw-headline\u0022 id=\u0022Part_III:_The_Destruction_of_the_Expeditionary_Force\u0022\u003EPart III: The Destruction of the Expeditionary Force\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/h5\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe winter weather in Akavir was also much more severe than expected. Due to the supply problems and the addition of thousands of civilians, the Expeditionary Force was on tight rations. To make matters worse, the Tsaesci raiders returned in force and harried any foraging and scouting parties outside the walls of the two cities. Several watch forts on the road between Septimia and Ionith were captured during blizzards, and the rest had to be abandoned as untenable. As a result, communication between the two cities had to be conducted entirely by magical means, a continuing strain on the legions\u0027 battlemages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn 5th Sun\u0027s Dawn, a large entourage of Tsaesci arrived at Ionith claiming to bring a peace offer from the Tsaesci king. That night, these treacherous envoys murdered the guards at one of the city gates and let in a strong party of their comrades who were waiting outside the city walls. Their clear intention was to assassinate the Emperor, foiled only by the vigilance and courage of troopers of the Tenth who were guarding his palace. Once the alarm was raised, the Tsaesci inside the city were hunted down and killed to the last man. Needless to say, this was the end of negotiations between the Emperor and the Tsaesci.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe arrival of spring only brought worse troubles. Instead of the expected spring rains, a hot dry wind began to blow from the east, continuing with varying strength through the entire summer. The crops failed, and even the river (which in the previous year had been navigable by small boats far upstream of Ionith) was completely dried up by Sun\u0027s Height. It is unknown if this was due to a previously unknown weather pattern unique to Akavir, or if the Tsaesci manipulated the weather through magical means. The Commission leans towards the former conclusion, as there is no direct evidence of the Tsaesci possessing such fearsome arcane power, but the latter possibility cannot be entirely ruled out.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDue to prolonged bad weather, the supply fleet was late in setting out from Black Harbor. It finally left port in early Second Seed, but was again severely mauled by storms and limped into Septimia eight weeks later much reduced. Because of the increasingly desperate supply situation in Akavir, the Emperor dispatched most of his Battlemage Corps with the fleet to assist it in weathering the storms which seemed likely to continue all summer. At this time, the Council urged the Emperor to abandon the invasion and to return to Tamriel with the Expeditionary Force, but he again refused, noting that the fleet was no longer large enough to transport all four legions at once. The Commission agrees that leaving one or more legions behind in Akavir to await the return of the fleet would have damaged Army morale. But the Commission also notes that the loss of one legion would have been preferable to the loss of the entire Expeditionary Force. It is the unanimous opinion of the Commission that this was the last point at which complete disaster might have been averted. Once the decision was made to send the fleet back for reinforcements and supplies, events proceeded to their inevitable conclusion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom this point on, much less is known about what transpired in Akavir. With most of the battlemages assisting the fleet, communication between the Expeditionary Force and Tamriel was limited, especially as the situation in Akavir worsened and the remaining battlemages had their powers stretched to the limit attending to all the needs of the legions. However, it appears that the Tsaesci may also have been actively interfering with the mages in some unknown manner. Some of the mages in Akavir reported their powers being abnormally weak, and the mages of the War College in \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Cyrodiil\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Cyrodiil\u0022\u003ECyrodiil\u003C/a\u003E (who were handling communications for the Council) reported problems linking up with their compatriots in Akavir, even between master and pupil of long training. The Commission urges that the War College make a particular study of the arcane powers of the Tsaesci, should the Empire ever come into conflict with Akavir again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat is known is that the Emperor marched out of Ionith in mid-Sun\u0027s Height, leaving only small garrisons to hold the cities. He had learned that the Tsaesci were massing their forces on the other side of a mountain range to the north, and he intended to smash their army before it could gather full strength and capture their supplies (of which he was in desperate need). This rapid advance seems to have taken the Tsaesci by surprise, and the Expeditionary Force crossed the mountains and fell on their camp, routing the Tsaesci army and capturing its leader (a noble of some kind). But the Emperor was soon forced to retreat, and the legions suffered heavily on their retreat to Ionith. The Emperor now found himself besieged in Ionith, cut off from the small garrison at Septimia which was also besieged. By this time, it seems that the efforts of the few remaining battlemages were devoted entirely to creating water to keep the army alive, a skill not normally emphasized at the War College. The fleet had arrived safely back to Black Harbor, thanks to the Battlemage Corps, but all attempts to return to Akavir were frustrated by a series of ever more savage storms that battered Esroniet throughout the rest of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Third_Era#3E_289\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Third Era\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022white-space:nowrap\u0022\u003E289\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Council\u0027s last contact with the Emperor was in early Frostfall. By Evening Star, the Council was extremely worried about the situation in Akavir and ordered the fleet to sail regardless of the risk. Despite the continued storms, the fleet managed to press on to Akavir. Hope was raised when contact was made with the Emperor\u0027s battlemage, who reported that Ionith still held out. Plans were quickly laid for the Expeditionary Force to break out of Ionith and fall back on Septimia, where the fleet would meet them. This was the last direct contact with the Expeditionary Force. The fleet arrived in Septimia to find its garrison under savage assault from a large Tsaesci army. The battlemages with the fleet threw back the enemy long enough for the survivors to embark and the fleet to withdraw.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe few survivors of the Expeditionary Force who reached Septimia told how the Emperor had led the army out of Ionith by night two days earlier, \u003Cspan title=\u0022Please do NOT CHANGE to \u0026quot;successfully\u0026quot;: the original source is intentionally copied and has the error.\u0022 style=\u0022border-bottom:1px dotted\u0022\u003Esuccesfully\u0026#160;\u003Ci\u003E\u003Csmall\u003E[\u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/UESPWiki:Spelling#Quotes\u0022 title=\u0022UESPWiki:Spelling\u0022\u003Esic\u003C/a\u003E]\u003C/small\u003E\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E breaking through the enemy lines but then being surrounded by overwhelming forces on the road to Septimia.

The unexpected weather which plagued the army and navy was particularly disastrous. Without the loss of a majority of the Far East Fleet during the campaign, the Expeditionary Force could have been withdrawn in 289. The weather also forced the Emperor to assign most of his Battlemage Corps to the fleet, leaving him without their valuable assistance during the fighting which soon followed. And of course the unexpected drought which struck Ionith during 289 dashed the hopes of supplying the army locally, and left the Expeditionary Force in an untenable situation when besieged in Ionith.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Tsaesci were also much stronger than intelligence reports had suggested. Information on the size of the army the Tsaesci were eventually able to field against the Expeditionary Force is vague, as the only serious fighting took place after regular communications were cut off between the Emperor and the Council. Nevertheless, it seems likely that the Tsaesci outnumbered the Emperor\u0027s forces by several times, as they were able to force four crack legions into retreat and then keep them under siege for several months.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs was stated previously, the Commission declines to criticize the initial decision to invade Akavir. Based on what was known at the time, the plan seemed sound. It is only with the benefit of hindsight does it become obvious that the invasion had very little chance of success. Nevertheless, the Commission believes several valuable lessons can be taken from this disaster.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, the Tsaesci may have extremely powerful arcane forces at their command. The possibility that they may have manipulated the weather across such a vast region seems incredible (and it should be noted that three Commissioners strongly objected to this paragraph even being included in this Report), but the Commission believes that this matter deserves urgent investigation. The potential danger is such that even the slight possibility must be taken seriously.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESecond, the Tsaesci appear to possess no navy to speak of. The Expeditionary Force was never threatened by sea, and the Far East Fleet fought nothing but the weather. Indeed, initial plans called for a portion of the Fleet to remain in Akavir for use in coastal operations, but in the event there were very few places where the large vessels of the Fleet could approach the land, due to the innumerable reefs, sandbars, islands, etc. that infested the coastal waters north and south from Septimia. Due to the utter lack of trees in the plain around Septimia and Ionith, the Expeditionary Force was unable to build smaller vessels which could have navigated the shallow coastal waters. Any future military expeditions against Akavir would do well to consider some way of bringing a means for inshore naval operations in order to exploit this clear advantage over the Tsaesci, an advantage that was sadly unexploited by the Expeditionary Force.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThird, much longer-term study needs to be made of Akavir before another invasion could even be contemplated. The information gathered over the four years prior to the invasion was extensive, but clearly inadequate. The weather conditions were completely unexpected; the Tsaesci much stronger than expected; and the attempted negotiations by the Emperor with the Tsaesci a disaster. Akavir proved alien beyond expectation, and the Commission believes any future attempt to invade Akavir should not be contemplated without much greater knowledge of the conditions, politics, and peoples of that continent than presently obtains.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the Commission unanimously concludes that given what we now know, any attempt to invade Akavir is folly, at least in the present state of the Empire. The Empire\u0027s legions are needed at home. One day, a peaceful, united Empire will return to Akavir and exact severe retribution for the disaster at Ionith and for our fallen Emperor. But that day is not now, nor in the foreseeable future.\u003C/p\u003E\n","Author":"Lord Pottreid, Chairman","Description":"An Imperial-scripted dispatch concerning Uriel V\u0027s invasion of Akavir","Type":"","CoverImage":"SR-icon-book-BasicBook2a.png"},{"Id":"00034CBC","Title":"Research Log","Text":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cfont face=\u0022$HandwrittenFont\u0022\u003EAttendant \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Gavros_Plinius\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Gavros Plinius\u0022\u003EGavros\u003C/a\u003E,\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cfont face=\u0022$HandwrittenFont\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Council has become aware of the lack of progress in your group\u0027s efforts.

Even if he had found four excellent examples from history of Battlemages casting spells outside their School \u2014 and he didn\u0027t \u2014 he would only have anecdotal evidence, which isn\u0027t enough to support an argument.

He calls it \u0022narrow and shallow\u0022 as an avenue of study, and its students impatient, with megalomaniac tendencies. How can one respond to this? Someone who knows nothing about casting a spell of Destruction criticizing the School for being too simple? Summarizing the School of Destruction as learning how to do the \u0022maximum amount of damage in the minimum amount of time\u0022 is clearly absurd, and he expounds on his ignorance by listing all the complicated factors studied in his own School of Illusion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAllow me in response to list the factors studied in the School of Destruction. The means of delivering the spell matters more in the School of Destruction than any other school, whether it is cast at a touch, at a range, in concentric circles, or cast once to be triggered later. What forces must be reigned in to cast the spell: \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Fire_Damage\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Fire Damage\u0022\u003Efire\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022/w/index.php?title=Skyrim:Lightning_Damage\u0026amp;action=edit\u0026amp;redlink=1\u0022 class=\u0022new\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Lightning Damage (page does not exist)\u0022\u003Elightning\u003C/a\u003E, or \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Frost_Damage\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Frost Damage\u0022\u003Efrost\u003C/a\u003E? And what are the advantages and dangers of each? What are the responses from different targets from the assault of different spells of destruction? What are the possible defenses and how may they be assailed? What environmental factors must be taken into consideration? What are the advantages of a spell of delayed damage? Bero suggests that the School of Destruction cannot be subtle, yet he forgets about all the Curses that fall under the mantle of the school, sometimes affecting generation after generation in subtle yet sublime ways.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe School of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Alteration\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Alteration\u0022\u003EAlteration\u003C/a\u003E is a distinct and separate entity from the School of Destruction, and Bero\u0027s argument that they should be merged into one is patently ludicrous. He insists \u2014 again, a man who knows nothing about the Schools of Alteration and Destruction, is the one insisting this \u2014 that \u0022damage\u0022 is part of the changing of reality dealt with by the spells of Alteration. The implication is that Levitation, to list a spell of Alteration, is a close cousin of Shock Bolt, a spell of Destruction. It would make as much sense to say that the School of Alteration, being all about the actuality of change, should absorb the School of Illusion, being all about the appearance of change.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt certainly isn\u0027t a coincidence that a master of the School of Illusion cast this attack on the School of Destruction.

All the chroniclers spoke of his sweetness and decency, how he saw a vision in his early years that brought him - with his father\u0027s blessing - from Skingrad to the Imperial City and the priesthood. The priesthood of Marukh, of course, saw no difference between spiritual and political matters. It was the religion of the Alessian Empire, and it taught that to resist the Emperor was to resist the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Eight_Divines\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Eight Divines\u0022\u003EGods\u003C/a\u003E. Given that, it is scarcely a surprise what Dorald did when he became King of the independent kingdom of Skingrad.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHis first edict, on his very first day, was to cede the kingdom to the Empire.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe reaction throughout the Colovian Estates was shock and outrage, nowhere more so than in the court of Kvatch. Rislav Larich, we are told, rode forth to his brother\u0027s kingdom, together with his wife and two dozen of his father-in-law\u0027s cavalry. It was surely not an impressive army, no matter how the chroniclers embellish it, but they had little trouble defeating all the guards Dorald sent to stop them. In truth, there was no actual battling, for the soldiers of Skingrad resented their new king\u0027s decision to give up their autonomy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe brothers faced one another in the castle courtyard where they had grown up.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn typical Colovian fashion, there was no trial, no accusations of treason, no jury, no judge. Only an executioner.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Thou art no brother of mine,\u0022 Rislav Larich said, and struck Dorald\u0027s head from his shoulders in one blow. He was crowned King of Skingrad still holding the same bloody axe in his arms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf King Rislav had no battle experience beforehand, that was shortly to change. Word spread quickly to the Imperial City that Skingrad, once offered, was now being taken back. Gorieus was an accomplished warrior even before taking the throne, and the seventeen years he had as Emperor were scarcely peaceful. Only eight months before Dorald\u0027s assassination and Rislav\u0027s ascendancy, Gorieus and the Alessian army had faced another of his coronation guests, Kjoric the White, on the fields of the frozen north.

Gorieus could not have thought actual battle was likely. Rislav, as we said, had little to no experience at warfare, and only a few days\u0027 practice at kingcraft. His kingdom and all of the Colovian West had just been ravaged by plague. The Alessians anticipated that a mere show of arms, and a surrender.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERislav instead prepared for battle. He quickly inspected his troops and drew up plans.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe chroniclers who had heretofore ignored the life of Rislav now devote verse after verse describing the king\u0027s aspect with fetishistic delight. While it may lack literary merit and taste, we are at least given some details at last. Not surprisingly, the king wore the finest armor of his era, as the Colovian Estates then had the finest leathersmiths - the only type of armor available - in all of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Tamriel\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Tamriel\u0022\u003ETamriel\u003C/a\u003E. The king\u0027s klibanion mail, boiled and waxed for hardness, and studded with inch-long spikes, was a rich chestnut red, and he wore it over his black tunic but under his black cloak. The statue of Rislav the Righteous which now stands in Skingrad is a romanticized version of king, but not inaccurate except in the armor represented. No bard of the Colovian West would have gone to the market so lightly protected. But it does, as we will see, include the most important accouterments of Rislav: his trained \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Hawk\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Hawk\u0022\u003Ehawk\u003C/a\u003E and his fast \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Horse\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Horse\u0022\u003Ehorse\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe winter rains had washed through the roads to the south, sending much of the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:West_Weald\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:West Weald\u0022\u003EWest Weald\u003C/a\u003E spilling into \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Valenwood\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Valenwood\u0022\u003EValenwood\u003C/a\u003E.

He ordered his personal guards to arrest the poor madman, but at that moment, the King of Skingrad raised his arm and sent his hawk flying into the sky. It was a signal his army had been waiting for.

He did not dare to look behind him, but his plan went faultlessly. The far eastern end of the pass was sealed by rolling boulders, giving the Alessian no direction to go but westward.

Even more spectacular treasures were out there, I felt, just waiting to be found, and I was eager to be off. I also had before me the salutary example of poor Bannerman, who was still dining out on his single expedition to \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Black_Marsh\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Black Marsh\u0022\u003EBlack Marsh\u003C/a\u003E twenty years ago. That would never be me, I vowed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith my letter from the Empress in hand, this time I would have the full cooperation of the Imperial authorities. No more need to worry about attacks from superstitious locals. But where should I look next? The ruins at \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Kemel-Ze\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Kemel-Ze\u0022\u003EKemel-Ze\u003C/a\u003E were the obvious choice. Unlike Raled-Makai, getting to the ruins would not be a problem. Also known as the \u0022Cliff City\u0022, Kemel-Ze lies on the mainland side of the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Vvardenfell\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Vvardenfell\u0022\u003EVvardenfel\u003C/a\u003E Rift, sprawling down the sheer coastal cliff. Travelers from the east coast of Vvardenfel often visit the site by boat, and it can also be reached overland from the nearby villages without undue hardship.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce my expedition had assembled in \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Seyda_Neen\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Seyda Neen\u0022\u003ESeyda Neen\u003C/a\u003E, with the usual tedious complications involved in operating in this half-civilized land, we set out for the village of \u003Ca href=\u0022/w/index.php?title=Skyrim:Marog\u0026amp;action=edit\u0026amp;redlink=1\u0022 class=\u0022new\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Marog (page does not exist)\u0022\u003EMarog\u003C/a\u003E near the ruins, where we hoped to hire a party of diggers. My interpreter, Tuen Panai, an unusually jolly fellow for a \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Dunmer\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Dunmer\u0022\u003EDark Elf\u003C/a\u003E who I had hired in Seyda Neen at the recommendation of the local garrison commander, assured me that the local villagers would be very familiar with Kemel-Ze, having looted the site for generations. Incidentally, Ten Penny (as we soon came to call him, to his constant amusement) proved invaluable and I would recommend him without hesitation to any of my colleagues who were planning similar expeditions to the wilds of Morrowind.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt Marog, we ran into our first trouble. The hetman of the village, a reserved, elegant old fellow, seemed willing to cooperate, but the local priest (a representative of the absurd \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Tribunal_Temple\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Tribunal Temple\u0022\u003Ereligion\u003C/a\u003E they have here, worshiping something called the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Tribunal\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Tribunal\u0022\u003ETribunal\u003C/a\u003E who they claim actually live in palaces in Morrowind) was fervently against us excavating the ruins. He looked likely to sway the villagers to his side with his talk of \u0022religious taboos\u0022, but I waved the Empress\u0027s letter under his nose and mentioned something about my friend the garrison commander at Seyda Neen and he quieted right down. No doubt this was just a standard negotiating tactic arranged among the villagers to increase their pay. In any event, once the priest had stalked off muttering to himself, no doubt calling down curses upon the heads of the foreign devils, we soon had a line of villagers eager to sign on to the expedition.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile my assistant was working out the mundane details of contracts, supplies, etc., Master Arum and I rode on to the ruins. By land, they can only be reached using narrow paths that wind down the face of the cliff from above, where any misstep threatens to send one tumbling into the sea foaming about the jagged rocks below. The city\u0027s original entrance to the surface must have been in the part of the city to the northeast - the part that fell into the sea long ago when the eruption of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Red_Mountain\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Red Mountain\u0022\u003ERed Mountain\u003C/a\u003E created this mind-bogglingly vast crater. After successfully navigating the treacherous path, we found ourselves in a large chamber, open to the sky on one side, disappearing into the darkness on the other. As we stepped forward, our boots crunched on piles of broken metal, as common in Dwarven ruins as potsherds in other ancient sites. This was obviously where the looters brought their finds from deeper levels, stripping off the valuable outer casings of the Dwarven mechanisms and leaving their innards here - easier than lugging the intact mechanisms back up to the top of the cliff. I laughed to myself, thinking of the many warriors unwittingly walking around \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Tamriel\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Tamriel\u0022\u003ETamriel\u003C/a\u003E with pieces of Dwarven mechanisms on their backs. For that, of course, is what most \u0022Dwarven armor\u0022 really is - just the armored shells of ancient mechanical men. I sobered when I thought of how exceedingly valuable an intact mechanism would be. This place was obviously full of Dwarven devices, judging from the litter covering the floor of this vast chamber - or had been, I reminded myself. Looters had been working over this site for centuries. Just the casing alone would be worth a small fortune, sold as armor. Most Dwarven armor is made of mismatched pieces from various devices, hence its reputation for being bulky and unwieldy. But a matched set from an intact mechanism is worth more than its weight in gold, for the pieces all fit together smoothly and the wearer hardly notices the bulk. Of course, I had no intention of destroying my finds for armor, no matter how valuable. I would bring it back to the Society for scientific study. I imagined the astonished cries of my colleagues as I unveiled it at my next lecture, and smiled again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI picked up a discarded gear from the piles at my feet. It still gleamed brightly, as if new-made, the Dwarven alloys resisting the corrosion of time. I wondered what secrets remained hidden in the maze of chambers that lay before me, defying the efforts of looters, waiting to gleam again in the light they had not seen in long eons. Waiting for me. It remained only to find them! With an impatient gesture to Master Arum to follow, I strode forward into the gloom.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMaster Arum, Ten Penny and I spent several days exploring the ruins while my assistants set up camp at the top of the cliff and hauled supplies and equipment from the village. I was looking for a promising area to begin excavation -- a blocked passage or corridor untouched by looters that might lead to completely untouched areas of the ruins.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe found two such areas early on, but soon discovered that the many winding passages bypassed the blockage and gave access to the rooms behind. Nevertheless, even these outer areas, for the most part stripped clean of artifacts by generations of looters, were full of interest to the professional archaeologist. Behind a massive bronze door, burst from its hinges by some ancient turmoil of the earth, we discovered a large chamber filled with exquisite wall-carvings, which impressed even the jaded Ten Penny, who claimed to have explored every Dwarven ruin in Morrowind. They seemed to depict an ancient ritual of some kind, with a long line of classically-bearded Dwarven elders processing down the side walls, all seemingly bowing to the giant form of a god carved into the front wall of the chamber, which was caught in the act of stepping forth from the crater of a mountain in a cloud of smoke or steam. According to Master Arum, there are no known depictions of Dwarven religious rituals, so this was an exciting find indeed. I set a team to work prying the carved panels from the wall, but they were unable to even crack the surface. On closer examination the chamber appeared to be faced with a metallic substance with the texture and feel of stone, impervious to any of our tools. I considered having Master Arum try his blasting magic on the walls, but decided that the risk of destroying the carvings was too great. Much as I would have preferred to bring them back to the Imperial City, I had to settle for taking rubbings of the carvings. If my colleagues in the Society showed enough interest, I was sure a specialist could be found, perhaps a master alchemist, who could find a way to safely remove the panels.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI found another curious room at the top of a long winding stair, barely passable due to the fall of rubble from the roof. At the top of the stair was a domed chamber with a large ruined mechanism at its center. Painted constellations were still visible in some places on the surface of the dome. Master Arum and I agreed that this must have been some kind of observatory, and the mechanism was therefore the remains of a Dwarven telescope. To remove it from ruins down the narrow stairway would require its complete disassembly (which fact no doubt had preserved it from the attention of looters), so I decided to leave it in place for the time being. The existence of this observatory suggested, however, that this room had once been above the surface. Closer examination of the structure revealed that this was indeed a building, not an excavated chamber. The only other doorways from the room were completely blocked, and careful measurements from the top of the cliff to the entry room and then to the observatory revealed that we were still more than 250 feet below the present ground level. A sobering reminder of the forgotten fury of Red Mountain.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis discovery led us to focus our attentions downward. Since we now knew approximately where the ancient surface lay, we could rule out many of the higher blocked passages. One wide passage, impressively flanked with carven pillars, particularly drew my interest. It ended in a massive rockfall, but we could see where looters had begun and then abandoned a tunnel through this debris. With my team of diggers and Master Arum\u0027s magery to assist, I believed we could succeed where our predecessors had failed. I therefore set my team of Dark Elves to work on clearing the passage, relieved finally to be beginning the real exploration of Kemel-Ze. Soon, I hoped, my boots would be stirring up dust that had lain undisturbed since the dawn of time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith this exciting prospect before me, I may have driven my diggers a bit too hard. Ten Penny reported that they were beginning to grumble about the long days, and that some were talking of quitting. Knowing from experience that nothing puts heart back into these Dark Elves like a taste of the lash, I had the ringleaders whipped and the rest confined to the ruins until they had finished clearing the passageway. Thank \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Stendarr\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Stendarr\u0022\u003EStendarr\u003C/a\u003E for my foresight in requisitioning a few legionnaires from Seyda Neen! They were sullen at first, but with the promise of an extra day\u0027s wages when they broke through, they soon set to work with a will. While these measures may sound harsh to my readers back in the comforts of civilization, let me assure you that there is no other way to get these people to stick to a task.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe blockage was much worse than I had first thought, and in the end it took almost two weeks to clear the passage. The diggers were as excited as I was when their picks finally broke through the far end into emptiness, and we shared a round of the local liquor together (a foul concoction, in truth) to show that all was forgiven. I could hardly restrain my eagerness as they enlarged the hole to allow entry into the chamber beyond. Would the passage lead to entire new levels of the ancient city, filled with artifacts left by the vanished Dwarves? Or would it be only a dead end, some side passage leading nowhere? My excitement grew as I slid through the hole and crouched for a moment in the darkness beyond. From the echoing sounds of the stones rattling beneath my feet, I was in a large room. Perhaps very large. I stood up carefully, and unhooded my lantern. As the light flooded the chamber, I looked around in astonishment. Here were wonders beyond even my wildest dreams!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the light from my lamp filled the chamber beyond the rock fall, I looked around in astonishment. Everywhere was the warm glitter of Dwarven alloys. I had found an untouched section of the ancient city! My heart pounding with excitement, I looked around me. The room was vast, the roof soaring up into darkness beyond the reach of my lamp, the far end lost in shadows with only a tantalizing glimmer hinting at treasures not yet revealed. Along each wall stood rows of mechanical men, intact except for one oddity: their heads had been ritually removed and placed on the floor at their feet. This could mean only one thing -- I had discovered the tomb of a great Dwarven noble, maybe even a king! Burials of this type had been discovered before, most famously by Ransom\u0027s expedition to \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Hammerfell\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Hammerfell\u0022\u003EHammerfell\u003C/a\u003E, but no completely intact tomb had ever been found. Until now.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut if this was truly a royal burial, where was the tomb? I stepped forward gingerly, the rows of headless bodies standing silently as they had for eons, their disembodied eyes seeming to watch me as I passed. I had heard wild tales of the Curse of the Dwarves, but had always laughed it off as superstition. But now, breathing the same air as the mysterious builders of this city, which had lain undisturbed since the cataclysm that spelled their doom, I felt a twinge of fear. There was some power here, I felt, something malevolent that resented my presence. I stopped for a moment and listened. All was silent.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EExcept... it seemed I heard a faint hiss, regular as breathing. I fought down a sudden surge of panic. I was unarmed, not thinking of danger in my haste to explore past the blocked passage. Sweat dripped down my face as I scanned the gloom for any movement. The room was warm, I suddenly noticed, much warmer than the rest of the labyrinth thus far. My excitement returned. Could I have found a section of the city still connected to a functioning steam grid? Pipes ran along the walls, as in all sections of the city. I walked over and placed my hand on one. It was hot, almost too hot to touch! Now I saw that in places where the ancient piping had corroded, small jets of steam were escaping -- the sound I had heard. I laughed at my own credulity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI now advanced quickly to the far end of the room, giving a cheerful salute to the ranks of mechanical soldiers who had appeared so menacing only moments before. I smiled with triumph as the light swept back the darkness of centuries to reveal the giant effigy of a Dwarven king standing on a raised dais, his metal hand clutching his rod of office. This was the prize indeed! I circled the dais slowly, admiring the craftsmanship of the ancient Dwarves. The golden king stood twenty feet tall under a freestanding domed cupola, his long upswept beard jutting forward proudly as his glittering metal eyes seemed to follow me. But my superstitious mood had passed, and I gazed benevolently on the old Dwarven king. My king, as I had already begun to think of him. I stepped onto the dais to get a better look at the sculpted armor. Suddenly the eyes of the figure opened and it raised a mailed fist to strike!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI leaped to one side as the golden arm came crashing down, striking sparks from the steps where I had stood a moment before. With a hiss of steam and the whir of gears, the giant figure stepped ponderously out from under its canopy and strode towards me with frightening speed, its eyes tracking me as I scrambled backwards. I dodged behind a pillar as the fist whistled down again. I had dropped my lantern in the confusion, and now I crept into the darkness outside the pool of light, hoping to slip between the headless mechanisms and thus escape back to the safety of the passageway. Where had the monster gone? You would think that a twenty-foot golden kind would be hard to miss, but he was nowhere to be seen. The guttering lamp only illuminated a small part of the room. He could be hiding anywhere in the gloom. I crawled faster. Without warning, the dim ranks of Dwarven soldiers in front of me went flying as the monstrous guardian loomed before me. He had cut off my escape! As I dodged backwards, blow after blow whistled down as the implacable machine followed me relentlessly, driving me into the far corner of the room. At last there was nowhere left for me to go. My back was to the wall. I glared up at my foe, determined to die on my feet. The huge fists lifted for one final blow.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe room blazed with sudden light. Bolts of purple energy crackled across the metal carapace of the Dwarven monster, and it halted, half-turning to meet this new threat. Master Arum had come! I was about to raise a cheer when the giant figure turned back to me, unharmed by the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Lightning_Bolt\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Lightning Bolt\u0022\u003Elightning bolt\u003C/a\u003E hurled by Master Arum, determined to destroy this first intruder. I shouted out \u0022Steam! Steam!\u0022 as the giant raised his fist to crush me into the floor. There was a hiss and a gust of bitter cold and I looked up. The monster was now covered with a shell of ice, frozen in the very moment of dispatching me. Master Arum had understood. I leaned against the wall with relief.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ice cracked above me. The giant golden king stood before me, the shell of ice falling away, his head swiveling towards me in triumph. Was there no stopping this Dwarven monstrosity?! But then the light faded from his eyes, and his arms dropped to his sides. The magical frost had worked, cooling its steam-driven energy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs Master Arum and the diggers crowded around me, congratulating me on my narrow escape, my thoughts drifted. I imagined my return to the Imperial City, and I knew that this would be my greatest triumph yet. How could I possibly top this find? Perhaps it was time to move on.

A pestilence was creeping across the ashlands, a menace with an insatiable hunger that plagued innocent travelers simply trying to get home. It was my self-sworn task to hunt them down one-by-one and drive them from the skies. Their fury knew no bounds and their war cry resonated across the land. They were the notorious \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Cliff_Racer\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Cliff Racer\u0022\u003Ecliff racers\u003C/a\u003E, and they had to be destroyed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn a particularly hot day during Sun\u0027s Height, I was tracking what I called a Lingerer... a cliff racer without a nest. He was a particularly feisty one too, leading me on a merry chase across almost three miles of ash dunes. I had managed to take a piece out of one of his wings in an earlier scuffle so he couldn\u0027t maintain much of a climb, but he still had quite a bit of stamina left and he was trying to make me tire of the chase. Almost two solid hours passed and my \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Silt_Strider\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Silt Strider\u0022\u003Esilt strider\u003C/a\u003E was tiring, but I couldn\u0027t give up...

I took a deep breath and pulled, trying to keep the cliff racer in my sights. It was literally a longshot with the beast gaining distance and the silt strider bouncing me around at full gallop. Finally, with a silent prayer, I released the string. The arrow sang through the air like a howling demon as it sliced its way towards its target. Finally, just as it crested the lip of a \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Foyada\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Foyada\u0022\u003Efoyada\u003C/a\u003E, the arrow struck it in the midsection.

The blasted thing had led me right to their nest and sacrificed itself with the intent of feeding me to its brood. It was a trap. The damned things had become much too clever. Knowing this was likely the end, I jumped down from the silt strider and hit the back of its leg with the flat of my glass blade. There was no need for the innocent thing to die here today because of my stupidity. As the ash cloud cleared from being stirred up by its massive legs, the cliff racer brood approached. I held my sword high and prepared for the worst.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe battle lasted two full days. I was beaten, clawed, bitten and knocked down more times than I care to remember.

A number of the dark elves have made their homes there, but they are expected to earn their livelihoods as is any other citizen of the great city. They ply trades as merchants, work in the temple, and serve in the keep. Honest labor, to be admired from a race that was so recently in such dire straits as to even warrant this discussion. Today the city still has its share of problems, but they are not traceable to any influx of outsiders in their presence. In short, the dark elves have properly assimilated themselves into the Skyrim way of life, to be expected from any newcomer to these lands.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor an alternative approach, we only have to look at the once-proud city of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Windhelm\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Windhelm\u0022\u003EWindhelm\u003C/a\u003E to see what can happen when our arms are cast too wide open in welcome.

They didn\u0027t want any of the diseased masses to get into their midst and spread the plague, so they built up quite a sophisticated security system for the time. Of course, it\u0027s mostly fallen into ruin, but I have a good idea about what kind of locks and traps might still be operational.

I was about to give up, but at the charterhouse, I met a monk who said that his masters were a hermetic group called the Order of St. Eadnua.

The thieves had a system that never failed. Heriah would find a way into the castle and collect as much loot as possible, while Indyk provided the distraction. He waited until his partner had scaled the wall before rapping on the gate. Perhaps this time he would be a bard, or a lost adventurer. The details were most fun to improvise.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHeriah heard Indyk talking to the woman who came to the gate, but she was too far away to hear the words exchanged. He was evidently successful: a moment later, she heard the door shut. The man had charm, she would give him that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOnly a few of the traps and locks to the armory had been set. Undoubtedly, many of the keys had been lost in time.

It took extra time to maneuver the intricate hasps and bolts of the new traps before proceeding to the old but still working systems, but Heriah found her heart beating with anticipation. Whatever lay beyond the door, she thought, must be of sufficient value to merit such protection.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen at last the door swung quietly open, the thief found her avaricious dreams paled to reality.

For a moment, she could not speak.

Each wore the uniform black robe that covered all features, and from the look of things, the feast was over.

Eslaf was starving, having not eaten anything but a rather scrawny raw squirrel in four days, and he smelled meat cooking and then found the smoke. A band of minstral bards was making camp. He watched them from the bushes as they cooked, and joked, and flirted, and sang.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe could\u0027ve asked them for some food, but so many others had refused him before. Instead, he rushed out, grabbed a piece of meat from the fire, and wincing from the burns, scrambled up the nearest tree to devour it while the bards stood under him and laughed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0027What is your next move, thief?\u0027 giggled a fair, red-headed woman who was covered with tattoos. \u0027How do you intend to disappear without us catching and punishing you?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the hunger subsided, Eslaf realized she was right. The only way to get out of the tree without falling in their midst was to take the branch down to where it hung over a creek. It was a drop off a cliff of about fifty feet. That seemed like the wisest strategy, so Eslaf began crawling in that direction.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0027You do know how to fall, boy?\u0027 called out a young \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Khajiit\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Khajiit\u0022\u003EKhajiit\u003C/a\u003Ei, but a few years older than Eslaf, thin but muscular, graceful in his slightest movements. \u0027If you don\u0027t, you should just climb down here and take what\u0027s coming to you. It\u0027s idiotic to break your neck, when we\u0027d just give you some bruises and send you on your way.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Of course I know how to fall,\u0027 Eslaf called back, but he didn\u0027t. He just thought the trick of falling was to have nothing underneath you, and let nature take its course. But fifty feet up, when you\u0027re looking down, is enough to give anyone pause.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0027I\u0027m sorry to doubt your abilities, Master Thief,\u0027 said the Khajiiti, grinning. \u0027Obviously you know to fall feet first with your body straight but loose to avoid cracking like an egg. It seems you are destined to escape us.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEslaf wisely followed the Khajiiti\u0027s hints, and leapt into the river, falling without much grace but without hurting himself. In the years that followed, he had to make several more drops from even greater heights, usually after a theft, sometimes without water beneath him, and he improved the basic technique.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen he arrived in the western town of Jallenheim on the morning of his twenty-first birthday, it didn\u0027t take him long to find out who was the richest person, most deserving of being burgled. An impregnable palace in a park near the center of town was owned by a mysterious young man named Suoibud. Eslaf wasted no time in finding the palace and watching it. A fortified palace he had come to learn was like a person, with quirks and habits beneath its hard shell.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was not an old place, evidently whatever money this Suoibud had come into was fairly recent. It was regularly patrolled by guards, implying that the rich man was fearful of \u003Cspan title=\u0022Please do NOT CHANGE to \u0026quot;being\u0026quot;: the original source is intentionally copied and has the error.\u0022 style=\u0022border-bottom:1px dotted\u0022\u003Ebeen\u0026#160;\u003Ci\u003E\u003Csmall\u003E[\u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/UESPWiki:Spelling#Quotes\u0022 title=\u0022UESPWiki:Spelling\u0022\u003Esic\u003C/a\u003E]\u003C/small\u003E\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E burgled, with good reason. The most distinctive feature of the palace was its tower, rising a hundred feet above the stone walls, doubtless giving the occupant a good defensive view. Eslaf guessed that that if Suoibud was as paranoid as he guessed him to be, the tower would also provide a view of the palace storehouse. The rich man would want to keep an eye on his fortune. That meant that the loot couldn\u0027t be directly beneath the tower, but somewhere in the courtyard within the walls.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe light in the tower shone all night long, so Eslaf boldly decided that the best time to burgle was by the light of day, when Suoibud must sleep. That would be the time the guards would least expect a thief to pounce.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so, when the noon sun was shining over the palace, Eslaf quickly scaled the wall near the front gate and waited, hidden in the crenelations. The interior courtyard was plain and desolate, with few places to hide, but he saw that there were two wells. One the guards used from time to time to draw up water and slake their thirst, but Eslaf noticed that guards would pass by the other well, never using it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe waited until the guards were distracted, just for a second, by the arrival of a merchant in a wagon, bearing goods for the palace. While they were searching his wagon, Eslaf leapt, elegantly, feet first, from the wall into the well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was not a particularly soft landing for, as Eslaf had guessed, the well was not full of water, but gold. Still, he knew how to roll after a fall, and he didn\u0027t hurt himself. In the dank subterranean storehouse, he stuffed his pockets with gold and was about to go to the door which he assumed would lead to the tower when he noticed a gem the size of an apple, worth more than all the gold that was left. Eslaf found room for it down his pants.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe door did indeed lead to the tower, and Eslaf followed its curving stairwell up, walking quietly but quickly. At the top, he found the master of the palace\u0027s private quarters, ornate and cold, with invaluable artwork and decorative swords and shields on the walls. Eslaf assumed the snoring lump under the sheets was Suoibud, but he didn\u0027t investigate too closely. He crept to the windows and looked out.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was going to be a difficult fall, for certes. He needed to jump from the tower, past the walls, and hit the tree on the other side. The tree branches would hurt, but they would break his fall, and there was a pile of hay he had left under the tree to prevent further injury.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEslaf was about to leap when the occupant of the room woke up with a start, yelling, \u0027My gem!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEslaf \u003Cspan title=\u0022Please do NOT EDIT this: the original source is intentionally copied and has the error.\u0022 style=\u0022border-bottom:1px dotted\u0022\u003Eand\u0026#160;\u003Ci\u003E\u003Csmall\u003E[\u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/UESPWiki:Spelling#Quotes\u0022 title=\u0022UESPWiki:Spelling\u0022\u003Esic\u003C/a\u003E]\u003C/small\u003E\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E stared at him for a second, wide-eyed.

The wily thief crept into the Baron\u0027s castle one night intending to do just that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe walls of the castle were noted for their height and unscalability. Ravius cleverly used an Arrow of Penetration to affix a rope to the top of the battlements. Once on the battlements, he had to evade the Baron\u0027s guards. By hiding in the shadows of the crenelations, he was able to work his way to the keep undetected.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEntering the keep was child\u0027s play for a thief of his caliber. However, a cunning lock with no less than 13 pins protected the private quarters of the Baron. Ravius broke only 9 lockpicks to open it. Using only a fork, a bit of string, and a wineskin, he disabled the seven traps guarding the Baron\u0027s coin collection. Truly Ravius was a master among thieves.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the coins safely in his grasp, Ravius began his escape only to find the way blocked.

He entered to find the lady preparing for bed. Now it should be said at this point that Ravius was noted for his handsome looks, while the Baroness was noted for her plainness.

But their happiness was short lived, and the settlers soon learned that not everyone celebrated the construction of Thirsk. As the mead hall was being erected, so too was the noise and commotion of construction disturbing an ancient creature that lay dormant under the ice. It was a tragic twist of irony, therefore, that as the last beam of the great hall was nailed in place, the slumbering beast did finally awaken. His ancient name was the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Udyrfrykte\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Udyrfrykte\u0022\u003EUdyrfrykte\u003C/a\u003E, though the settlers knew him only as death. The Udyrfrykte came to the newly completed mead hall and wreaked vengeance upon those who had shattered the peace of his long, cold sleep. He killed without warning, without mercy, reducing the Thirsk Nords to half their number. It was the valiant sorcerer Eldrid Ice-Light who finally drove the beast back to his lair beneath the frozen lake, and used his magicka to seal the entrance with a great wall of ice. The horror was over, but the price was great. It took the settlers two months to fix the damage done by the Udyrfrykte, and with so many strong hands now gone, it was slow and tedious work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, Thirsk stood tall and proud once more. But even though the settlers had worked together to construct the mead hall and drive away the threat of the Udyrfrykte, tensions quickly grew over who would serve as their leader. Most of the men considered \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Hrothmund_the_Red\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Hrothmund the Red\u0022\u003EHrothmund the Red\u003C/a\u003E their de facto chieftain, as he was the strongest and most capable of the lot. But one warrior, Drengr Bronze-Helm, disagreed. He thought himself most capable to rule over Thirsk, and loudly voiced his opposition to Hrothmund. Knowing that conflict and discord would only serve to destroy the new life they had worked so hard to create, Hrothmund the Red exercised his only true option - he swung his great axe and beheaded Drengr Bronze-Helm where he stood. The Nords appreciated more than anything a warrior\u0027s prowess in battle, and Drengr\u0027s slaying proved to them that Hrothmund was indeed most worthy to be Thirsk\u0027s chieftain. So that the other Nords would never forget he had proven his right to lead, Hrothmund placed Drengr\u0027s head on a pedestal in the center of Thirsk\u0027s main hall, for all to see.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so began Thirsk\u0027s most time-honored tradition. Any warrior, regardless of race or sex, could claim leadership of the mead hall by displaying the most impressive battle trophy on the great hall\u0027s pedestal.

With his soft voice and great axe -- which was said to be the largest weapon of its kind ever wielded by a Nord -- Hrothmund brought peace and prosperity to Thirsk. But peace proved to be Hrothmund\u0027s undoing, for the mighty Nord grew restless in the warmth and safety of the mead hall. He longed for battle and adventure, to feel the frost in his veins once more, and could ignore the call of valor no longer.

The men of the mountains named him Ondjage, the Fell Wolf. The beast measured as large as an ox, with fur as white as new-fallen snow, and it was said no man or woman alive could bring Ondjage down. The words of the mountain folk proved true, for while Hrothmund did hew one leg from the Fell Wolf, Ondjage devoured the mighty Nord whole, leaving only his great axe as a grim reminder of man\u0027s failure against beast. Filled with sorrow and rage, the residents of Thirsk marched to the mountains in search of the wolf, called by them Hrothmund\u0027s Bane.

As the fog of near fatal starvation began to lift, I looked up from my plate to see a gold-masked stranger looking at me, his vizard glowing by the blinding light of the moon through the window. He wore black leather armor and was a different physique and size from the man I had burgled, but I could tell he knew. I paid for my meal quickly and left.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI skirted the edge of the village, through a tiled central courtyard surrounded by the squalid peasant\u0027s cottages. There was not a light shining from any window or door. No one was on the streets. I could find no place to hide, so I took the road out of town, heading for the wilderness. Hunger had pushed me on in the days before, but now I felt what I imagined to be the whip of guilt. Or perhaps, even then, it was fear.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI fell twice, rushing down the dark path, unused to the slopes and pebbled texture.

I knew enough about concealment to pick a spot where the bulwark sunk slightly so even if someone saw the outline of my figure, he would assume it to be part of the wall. It wasn\u0027t long before I heard the sound of running footsteps from more than one person pass me by and then stop. There was a moment of whispered conversation, and one of the people ran back on the path toward the village. Then, silence.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter a few more minutes, I peered out from behind the wall. A female figure in a dun gown, wimple, and veil stood in the road. On the other end of the road, blocking the way back to town, was a knight, coated in dark mail. I could see neither of their faces.

Into the night forest I ran, the maddening jingle of the accursed gold in my pocket. I knew I was making so much noise my pursuers could not help but hear me, but now I cared more for putting distance between us than in stealth. Clouds of ash filtered through the moonlight, but I still knew it was too bright to hide. I ran and ran until I felt all my blood pumping in my head and heart, begging me to stop.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI was at the edge of the wood, on the other side of a shallow stream from a vast, crumbling house encircled by a rail fence. Behind me, running footfall in the broken, dusty earth. To the south, downstream, a distinct sodden splashing of someone moving nearer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was no choice. I half jumped and half fell into the mud and dragged myself up the bank on the other side. I rolled under the fence and ran through the open field toward the house. Jerking my head around, I saw seven shadowy figures by the fence posts. The cloaked man I had robbed. The man in the gold mask. The veiled woman. The dark knight. Three others too who had pursued me, but I had never seen. And I thought I was the stealthy one.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe moon was entirely hidden in a swarm of ash.

I know it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the days approached towards the Wraith\u0027s wedding day, there was certainly something sinister in the air that Kepkajna could smell when she was not transported by heady bliss. Dark figures seemed to shift in the shadows and disappear when approached. She recognized the clothing of some beggars near Wodworg\u0027s cottage as costumes, but the mendicants hurried away before she could recognize which of her old gang was stalking her.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut these moments of apprehension were few. Kepkajna was truly happy, making arrangements for the ceremony to be performed at the very dungeon where Wodworg had imprisoned her. Her father was long since dead -- another victim of the ash ghouls -- but her fiance\u0027s commander volunteered to act in his behalf. Of course, Kepkajna had to supply her own dowry. She spent every last mark of her savings of ill-gotten gain to buy her beloved a truly wonderful present.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe wedding was set for the stroke of midnight, as is \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Orc\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Orc\u0022\u003EOrc\u003C/a\u003E tradition. The handmaidens, wives of Imperial officers, were busily sewing her into her gown of red velvet and fine gold filigree in the mid-morning. Dolcetta, one of the handmaidens, remarked that she had heard that Kepkajna had bought Wodworg a truly beautiful gift for her dowry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Let me show it to you,\u0022 Kepkajna giggled, dashing from the room half-dressed to her hidden alcove. The present had been stolen.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe women were horrified, but the Wraith found herself merely irritated, not surprised. This was truly the old gang\u0027s style. They knew that a wedding ceremony without a dowry was marked as unlucky. She asked her handmaidens to finish dressing her quickly while she pondered what the burglars would have done with her treasure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe whole region was honeycombed with secret lairs and abandoned sites thieves used to store their loot. There were obvious places, of course, but after much reflection, she thought of where she would have put it under similar circumstances. Once the handmaids had finished, Kepkajna bade them to make certain that the ceremony went on as scheduled, and not to fret as she might be a little late. She wrapped herself in a shawl to protect her gown from dungeon dust and set off for the Shrine of \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Malacath\u0022 class=\u0022mw-redirect\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Malacath\u0022\u003EMalacath\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Wraith had never before attempted to rob her own friends, and though she was peeved at them for trying to ruin her happiness, she had no interest in hurting them physically. Her style was to avoid conflict, though she knew it would be inevitable. The lessons her mentor Khargol had given her had helped her avoid the lances and blades of guards and Imperial Knights over the years: now she would see if they would allow her to survive a den of thieves and the unknown dangers of the Shrine. Without, most importantly, ruining her dress.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe desolate place was so empty as she delved into it that she feared she might have made a miscalculation. It was not until she found the small room hidden down a long corridor that she knew she was at the right place, and that it was well suited for an ambush. She grabbed the chest with her treasure within, and turned to face the assault.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo of her old gang, Yorum and Yohr-i the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Redguard\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Redguard\u0022\u003ERedguard\u003C/a\u003E twin brother and sister, were outside the door as she came from the room. They knew the Wraith better than to taunt her and immediately attacked. Yorum struck out with a left thrust of his blade while Yohr-i sought to rush her. The Wraith neatly sidestepped Yohr-i, while dropping her weight to her rear left leg, shifting her right shoulder to the left to slip past Yorum\u0027s strike. The twins crashed into one another and Kepkajna passed swiftly on.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlmost immediately, she was set on by the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Argonian\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Argonian\u0022\u003EArgonian\u003C/a\u003E Binyaar, his mace whistling through the air at her head. They had never much liked one another. The Wraith snapped into a duck, so the mace whacked with a tremendous clamor against the stone wall. Binyaar was thrown off balance, giving her a few seconds lead hurrying up the passage. Ahead she could smell the fresh night air.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe last of her dowry\u0027s defenders was Sorogth, an Orc with whom she had shared a brief romance. It was he who Kepkajna knew had masterminded the theft. In a way and in context, she thought, his devotion to her misery was rather sweet. At the moment, though, she was most concerned with avoiding his barbed ax that seemed ideal for breaking her dress\u0027s fine stitchwork and the flesh beneath.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBending her knees slightly, bobbing to avoid strikes to the head, weaving her head to confuse Sorogth of her next move, shuffling her feet arrhythmically, the Wraith made an impossible target. She ducked inside his thrusts, sidestepped his swings, and then sidestepped his thrusts, and ducked his swings. As erratic as she tried to make her defensive moves, Sorogth still kept pace with her, refusing to budge from his position at the dungeon outlet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMidnight was coming, and the Wraith finally decided that she must end the confrontation. When Sorogth swung out next, she sidestepped to her left, swayed down, and ducked her head, so the ax whistled over her right shoulder. In that instant, his right side was exposed, and she reluctantly smashed the chest hard into his torso. There was not enough time for Kepkajna to see if she had killed him or merely knocked him unconscious. In truth, she thought of nothing else but rushing to her wedding ceremony.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt precisely midnight, Wodworg and Kepkajna were united together. He was delighted with her dowry gift, a fine suit of armor that would make him the envy of other Imperial jailers. Even more, he was enchanted by his wife\u0027s tale of retrieving it from the Shrine of Malacath.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Did it occur to you to put on the armor when you knew that it was an ambush?\u0022 he asked.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I didn\u0027t want to dent your present,\u0022 she replied, between kisses. \u0022And I certainly didn\u0027t want to wrinkle my gown.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n","Author":"Voltha gra-Yamwort\n(translated by Apthorne)","Description":"Story of how an Orc reclaims her wedding gift from thieves","Type":"","CoverImage":"SR-icon-book-BasicBook5.png"},{"Id":"000D9B6B","Title":"Wyndelius\u0027s Journal","Text":"\n\u003Ch4\u003E\u003Cspan class=\u0022mw-headline\u0022 id=\u00224E_200.2C_18_Morning_Star\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Lore:Fourth_Era#4E_200\u0022 title=\u0022Lore:Fourth Era\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022white-space:nowrap\u0022\u003E4E 200\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E, 18 Morning Star\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/h4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve set up camp inside the \u003Ca href=\u0022/wiki/Skyrim:Shroud_Hearth_Barrow\u0022 title=\u0022Skyrim:Shroud Hearth Barrow\u0022\u003Ebarrow\u003C/a\u003E.
